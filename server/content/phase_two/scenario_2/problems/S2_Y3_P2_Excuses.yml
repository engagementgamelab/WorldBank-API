initiating_dialogue: "I feel we've been misled about the situation on the ground here. Rising fuel prices are one thing, but the cultural barriers we've had to deal with are beyond what were initially described. I am confident we can meet our targets next year, but only if we get our bonuses this year. Otherwise, the entire program is doomed."
