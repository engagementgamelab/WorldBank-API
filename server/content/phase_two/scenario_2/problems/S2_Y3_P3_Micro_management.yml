name: "Training Protocols"
priority: 3
year: 3

initiating_npc: dep_minister_of_health
initiating_dialogue: "We recently requested some very simple information from the NGO, and they refused to supply it. We have yet to see their training curriculum on infection control, and we're beginning to wonder why."

starting_options: [clarification_of_roles_7]

starting_options_cost: [small]

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "This curriculum is of particular interest to us since infection control is crucial, and we want to know how their employees are trained on this so we can approve it."
    unlocks: [warn_ngo_6]
    unlocks_affects: [warn_ngo_6]

  ngo_manager:
    dialogue: "Are we required by the contract to furnish this information? It's our property, after all, and we have a vested interest in keeping our processes private."
    feedback:
        warn_ngo_6: "I hear what you're saying, but I don't intend to change our practices unless itâ€™s mandated. Providing all this extra info requires a lot of work which I'd rather spend on actually training the staff."
        clarification_of_roles_7: "I thought our roles were already clear. I still see no reason to provide this information. Why should the government approve something so granular?"
        include_approval_ngo_curriculum_1: "If you really think it's necessary, we'll make this information available and allow the Ministry to approve it."

  coach:
    dialogue: "If the contract does not state the NGO is to provide their training curricula for approval, perhaps it should. At the start of the new year, let's revise this to make it clear"

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "I have no idea how their organization operates internally, sorry."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "This seems like a dispute between the NGO and the ministry. Talk to them about it."
