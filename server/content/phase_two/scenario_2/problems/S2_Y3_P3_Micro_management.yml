  dep_minister_of_health: 
    dialogue: "We need the NGO to be accountable and if that's a problem with them, we're not going to be able to work with them."
    unlocks: [terminate_ngo_contract_5]
    feedback:
      clarification_of_roles_7: "We keep going around and around with this. For the future, it is not your position to clarify ours."

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "We're not making any unreasonable requests. In fact, they're pretty sound, and the Ministry does not need push back for looking into the health of its constituents. At least make them think harder about complaining next time."

    unlocks_affects: [sanction_ngo_1]

  ngo_manager:
    feedback:
        terminate_ngo_contract_5: "Best of luck, but this is not as easy as you think it is."
        sanction_ngo_1: "You can slap us on the wrist, but we are getting people help."

  coach:
    dialogue: "However unlikely it seems at this point, maybe the NGO doesn't really understand who's calling the shots."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "*Helpless laugh* I don't know!"

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "I wouldn't say checking in constitutes micromanagement, but I'm not seeing these memos, so I don't know."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "The Ministry signs the checks. Sometimes, we get to cash them and get people healthy. Ask them and whomever they have helping you."
