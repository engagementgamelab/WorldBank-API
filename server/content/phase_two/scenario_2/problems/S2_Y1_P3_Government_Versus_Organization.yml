    feedback:
      cease_counter_verification: "If you think they don't need more looking into, that's fine, I trust you."

  director_regional_health_services: 
    dialogue: "I'm with the Dep. Minister on this. We are responsible for how the NGO operates."

  ngo_manager:

    feedback:
      pressure_the_ngo_to_comply_1: "It takes a lot of time for us to comply with all these verifications. I'm worried we won't have time to meet our goals if we're busy with paperwork."

  coach:
    dialogue: "The problem doesn't have to do with anyone but the NGO and the Third Party Verifier. Hammer it out with them."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "It wouldn't be a lot more paperwork for us to submit for counter-verification, but I don't know that it's necessary."
