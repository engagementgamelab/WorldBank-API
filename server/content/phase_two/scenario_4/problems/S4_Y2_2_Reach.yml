  dep_minister_of_health:
    feedback:
      increase_funding_for_ngo_2: "You realize you're rewarding these people for failure? I don't want to step in on this issue. Don't make me."

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "We're seeing underserved populations throughout the south. The NGO is falling short of their promises, especially in this area."

  ngo_manager:
    dialogue: "It's been a lot harder to reach some populations than we expected, especially down there. Health facilities in this region are much shorter on supplies and staff than we originally estimated, and there's no budget for us to make up the shortfall."

    feedback:
      terminate_contract_at_end_of_year_9: "We can't, cannot, get to absolutely everyone, so you're making it impossible to get health care for everyone else. That's self-defeating!"
      contract_additional_ngo_2: "I think we could have done it, but it would be a lot of work to reach that province. I appreciate the help."

  coach:
    dialogue: "Look, we have one group running things pretty well for most of the country. Maybe we need someone to run support for them who's more used to this kind of issue."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "I'm sure they are having trouble getting to some people, but no informational campaign is going to reach everybody."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "You can always just guide the NGO on how they should address this. It might be kind of micro-manage-y, but that's what you have a coach for, right?"

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "That is why you brought the NGO in, to get people treated. There might be someone who could do it better. Maybe you should revisit the contract at the end of the year?"
