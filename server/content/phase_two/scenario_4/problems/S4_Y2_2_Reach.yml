  dep_minister_of_health:
    feedback:
      increase_funding_for_ngo_2: "You realize you're rewarding these people for failure? Please make sure that this is the right decision."

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "The health care providers and NGOs are working hard, but there are many social and cultural barriers in this region."

  ngo_manager:
    dialogue: "It's been a lot harder to reach some populations than we expected, especially down there. The people living in the South are more entrenched in traditional medicine, and that's a big obstacle for us to get over when we can only afford the health care itself."

    feedback:
      terminate_contract_at_end_of_year_9: "We cannot get to absolutely everyone, so you're making it impossible to get health care for everyone else. That's self-defeating!"
      contract_additional_ngo_2: "I think we could have done it, but it would be a lot of work to reach that province in the south, so I think that this is for the best."

  coach:
    dialogue: "Look, we have one group running things pretty well for most of the country. Maybe we need another NGO who is more used to this kind of region, to better focus on the population."

    unlocks_affects: [contract_additional_ngo_2]

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "I'm sure they are having trouble getting to some people, but it is impossible to reach everybody."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "You can always just guide the NGO on how they should address this. It might be kind of micro-manage-y, but that's what you have a coach for, right?"

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "That is why you brought the NGO in, to get people treated. There might be someone who could do it better. Maybe you should revisit the contract at the end of the year?"
