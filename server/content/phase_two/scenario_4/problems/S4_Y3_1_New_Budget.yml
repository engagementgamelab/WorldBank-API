initiating_dialogue: "I received a memo today about the new national health budget and policy guidance. The ministry has released new purchasing and ordering guidelines for all providers and the NGO. It takes away even more of our autonomy. This is bad news for us."

  dep_minister_of_health:
    dialogue: "Our auditors have found mismanagement of funds. The providers need strict guidelines to provide the necessary services, and use the funds appropriately."
    feedback:
      grant_autonomy_to_providers_6: "This revision to the procurement guideline is within the scope of regulation, which is my role. But if you think it's essential for the providers to keep autonomy, we will step back on this."

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "If the Ministry is claiming this is necessary, I would take it seriously. A compromise might be to re-work the RBF Manual and trainings with Ministry oversight."

  ngo_manager:
    dialogue: "We are doing our best to deliver these services, but the government controls the drugs, not us. We try to treat as many patients as we can, but if the Ministry strangles our supply, it doesn't work."

  coach:
    dialogue: "I have found some mismanagement of funds in the past as well, but appropriate actions were taken. We are supposed to be granting more autonomy, not taking it away! Especially as the NGO and subsequently the providers are paid for the services they have already provided."
    unlocks: [grant_autonomy_to_providers_6]

    feedback:
      comply_with_ministry_11: "I really don't believe this is the best option but if you insist...We'll see how it goes."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "We are verifying the results and ensure that the NGO and thus the providers get paid accurately. So why take away their autonomy?"

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "I don't understand the need for these new guidelines, but then again, I am not working in the clinic."

  clinic_manager: 
    feedback:
      rework_business_plan_2: "I don't believe this will be constructive, but I'm willing to try. We'll see how it goes."
