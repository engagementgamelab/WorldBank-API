    feedback:
      cease_counterverification_by_government: "If you think they don't need more looking into, that's fine, I trust you."
      clarification_of_roles_10: "Next time, let's try to avoid this by making everyone's job clear beforehand. Thanks."

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "I'm with the Minister on this, I want to know what the NGOs are doing. I would advise speaking to them directly."

  ngo_manager:
    dialogue: "We verify everything I promise. We also give the third party access to verify so there is no need for the government to also verify."

    feedback:
      pressure_ngo_to_comply_10: "It takes a lot of time for us to comply with all these verifications. I'm worried we won't have time to meet our targets if we're busy with paperwork."

  coach:
    dialogue: "Hate to say it, but the NGO has too much power over the budget. We should alter the program to allow providers to make these decisions at their level."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "We really don't need the government to counter-verify. We are handling this process just fine."

    unlocks_affects: [clarification_of_roles_10]

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "It wouldn't be a lot more paperwork for us to submit for counter-verification, but I don't know that it's necessary. Is the Third Party not providing a copy to the government?"
