initiating_dialogue: "In many of my focus groups, there's an air of mistrust with the hospitals and clinics. People who go there have experienced terrible service, and word's getting around."

    dialogue: "We're paying for the NGO to provide increased quantity and improved quality of services, and if they are not doing that we should sanction them."
    unlocks: [sanction_ngo_4]
    unlocks_affects: [sanction_ngo_4]

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "Providers in my region have complained often of over-stressed staff. There are not enough workers, and supplies are still running out frequently."

  ngo_manager:
    dialogue: "As long as the Ministry is not allowing us to hire staff it is difficult for us to improve the situation."
    unlocks: [increase_ngo_autonomy_2]
    unlocks_affects: [increase_ngo_autonomy_2]
    feedback:
      warn_ngo_5: "I'll do what I can, but we're struggling as it is. I don't know how we can improve without being able to hire staff ourselves."
      increase_ngo_autonomy_2: "This will really help us improve quality and I assure you patients will be treated better when staff are less stressed with the workload."

  coach:
    dialogue: "Patient satisfaction is a huge part of quality of care. If staff aren't doing it now, maybe we need to increase incentives."
    unlocks: [increase_customer_service_incentives_2] # <--- these probably will symbols
    unlocks_affects: [increase_customer_service_incentives_2]
    feedback:
      increase_customer_service_incentives_2: "I'll notify everyone about the change. I think we'll see a big difference soon."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "Providers struggle to meet their quality of care milestones. Bad service is half the problem. It might not be my place to say so, but firing staff and hiring new people might be the best way to go."

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "I have less control over my staff than you might think. When we struggle to fill demand on a day to day basis, there isn't much time left over for morale-building and discipline."
    feedback:
      sanction_ngo_4: "You realize that when you sanction the NGO, the money tends to come out of my budget? You cannot keep doing this to us."
