  coach:
    dialogue: "The contract says that the NGO should be using the national protocols, but it looks like they are using their own set of guidelines. You should talk to them, and the ministry to work this out."

    feedback:
      hold_stakeholder_meeting_5: "For a problem like this, a truce is about as good as we can hope for. Well, maybe not a truce, as such. More of a cease fire."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "There's plenty of work to be done without these arguments."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "The other day, a woman was getting her prenatal checkup. She's waiting in the examination room for the doctor to arrive, but she was almost 30 minutes late because someone from the NGO was lecturing her on what kind of care to give. That has got to stop."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "I couldn't do what the NGO Director does. No argument there. But they are in my country. They should respect our health guidelines."
