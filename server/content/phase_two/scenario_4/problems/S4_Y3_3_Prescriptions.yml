  dep_minister_of_health:
    dialogue: "That's unacceptable. I think it's time we looked for someone else to fulfill these duties. Letting the NGO go and contracting facilities directly would give us far better oversight."

    unlocks_affects: [terminate_contract_at_end_of_year_10]

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "We must conduct an investigation right away. Begin by speaking directly with the health providers and find out why this is happening."
    narrows: [dep_minister_of_health, director_regional_health_services, ngo_manager, third_party_verifier]

  ngo_manager:
    dialogue: "I run the entire health network of Zariba and can't be everywhere at once. In the end, I am responsible, but I'm not being given the support I need."
    feedback:
      warning_18: "Everyone who works for me is doing their best. I don't know what I can do without an increase in resources."
      sanctions_16: "I need an increase in resources to deal with this, not a cut! How can I fix this problem if I'm hamstrung by sanctions?"

  coach:
    dialogue: "This sounds like we may have been incentivising the wrong things. Adhering to best practices is much more important than satisfied patients. Let's rethink this."

    feedback:
      tie_incentives_directly_to_protocol_2: "I'll work on implementing this change. I think this will prove to be a turning point in producing quality results."
      terminate_contract_at_end_of_year_10: "I'll inform the NGO and begin transitioning into contracting directly with providers early next year."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "This is a mess. I'll take another look. It would be very easy for us to verify whether they're really following protocols."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "At first I was shocked to hear this, but the more I thought about it, the more it makes sense. Patients don't know the difference, and if we're incentivising happy patients, the wrong medicine is better than no medicine."
