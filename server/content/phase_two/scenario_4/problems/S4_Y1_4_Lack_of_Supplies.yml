initiating_dialogue: "Bad news. We have surveyed many patients from the hospitals and local clinics, and at every focus group, someone reports being turned away without services."

    dialogue: "If people are being turned away, it's because funds are being mismanaged. Sanctions may be the only thing that makes a difference."
    unlocks: [sanction_ngo_3]
    unlocks_affects: [sanction_ngo_3]

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "This is a serious problem. It's hard enough getting people to hospitals even when services are abundant."
    feedback:
      increase_supply_budget_2: "We have increased the budget every year. I am not optimistic this will solve the problem."

  ngo_manager:
    dialogue: "If the government would just let us do the purchasing, then we would not run low on supplies, and we wouldn't have to turn patients away."
    unlocks: [increase_ngo_autonomy_1]
    unlocks_affects: [increase_ngo_autonomy_1]
    feedback:
      warn_ngo_4: "Warning received. I'll discuss this with our health providers and work on a solution."
      grant_facilities_autonomy_2: "This problem is due to facilities mismanaging what they are given, not my budget lines. It's not a good idea to give them more responsibility when they've done such a bad job with what they have."
      sanction_ngo_3: "How are we supposed to accomplish anything if you keep handicapping us? You understand this is going to affect care outcomes."

  coach:
    dialogue: "Maybe the budget for the medical store has been set too low?"
    unlocks: [increase_supply_budget_2] # <--- these probably will symbols
    unlocks_affects: [increase_supply_budget_2]

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "The numbers are poor, but at least the facilities don't appear to be exaggerating them."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "We put in requests for supplies, but they are not filled in a timely way. We get too much of some things, and not enough of others. If we could order or purchase our own supplies directly, this wouldn't be a problem, but the Ministry sets our orders down to the exact number of syringes."
    unlocks: [grant_facilities_autonomy_2]
    unlocks_affects: [grant_facilities_autonomy_2]
    feedback:
      increase_ngo_autonomy_1: "I'm at a loss. I'll hold a meeting with my staff and the RBF Coach and try to figure out how to resolve this."
