  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "Maybe the budget for the medical store has been set too low."
    feedback:
      increase_supply_budget_2: "We have increased the budget every year. I am not optimistic this will solve the problem."

    feedback:
      increase_ngo_autonomy_1: "I'll see to this. In addition, we should issue a recommendation to the ministry about the usefulness of autonomy in RBF, as this is clearly not well understood."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "The numbers are poor, but at least the facilities don't appear to be exaggerating them."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "We put in requests for supplies, but they are not filled in a timely way. We get too much of some things, and not enough of others. Maybe the NGO can help, they seem pretty well organized."
