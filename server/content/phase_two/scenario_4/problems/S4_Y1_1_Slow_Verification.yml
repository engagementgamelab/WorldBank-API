    feedback:
      speed_third_party_hire_1: "We realize this is important, and we'll make every effort to ensure it goes smoothly."
      request_expedited_payment_1: "We're working at capacity to get this done. Things are just taking a little longer than we planned."

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "I'm not sure what the delay is. I'd speak with the Deputy Minister or the Third Party Verifier"

  ngo_manager:
    feedback:
      speed_third_party_hire_1: "You hired us to manage this! Why not give us a chance?"

  coach:
    dialogue: "These delays will cause a cascade of failures. I recommend expediting payments to avoid a negative feedback loop."


  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "We're waiting on some paperwork to clear before we're officially on the job. As soon as this decision is finalized and we get our contract, we'll take care of it."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "The Ministry takes forever to do anything. They need to be prodded, I think."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "I have a good relationship with the government, but double-checking takes twice as long. That means it takes twice the time for us to get paid, and my budget can't take that strain."
