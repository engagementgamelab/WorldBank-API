characters:

  # The below blocks would contain each character that you can interact with (we'll enable/disable them based on the player's "inventory") # <--- character's symbol

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "I suggest hiring more outreach staff to operate in facilities near these settlements."
    unlocks: [hire_more_outreach_staff]
    unlocks_affects: [hire_more_outreach_staff]
    feedback:
      hire_more_outreach_staff: "This makes a good deal of sense to me."

  coach:
    dialogue: "We've tried many strategies to improve stagnant indicators. Perhaps the indicators need to be reviewed at the end of the year?"
    unlocks: [review_indicators_at_end_of_year]
    unlocks_affects: [review_indicators_at_end_of_year]
    feedback:
      review_indicators_at_end_of_year: "It might make sense to revise goals down, or at the very least, perform another survey to make sure our population estimates were correct."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "Are you concerned about fraud? I haven't seen direct evidence of it."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "People here are still reluctant to travel to facilities."

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "I admit, we haven't seen as many facility births as we'd like. We're doing everything we can to change that."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "Vaccinations are easier to manage. Births take more planning. More resources are likely required to make this work."
    unlocks: [raise_incentives_for_facility_births]
    unlocks_affects: [raise_incentives_for_facility_births]
    feedback:
      raise_incentives_for_facility_births: "That will make this a good deal easier for us."
