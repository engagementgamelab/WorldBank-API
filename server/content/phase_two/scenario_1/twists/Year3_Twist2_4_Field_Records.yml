    feedback:
      increase_funding_for_verifiers_2: "Really? I don't think we should be rewarding mismanagement."

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "It might help if they were clearing their movements through my office. Then we would know where they are going, and that they are headed where they're needed."

    unlocks_affects: [centralize_control_over_travelling_nurses_2]

  coach:
    dialogue: "Our CBO partners should be confirming all of this. I don't think it's the nurses' fault. The verifiers need to know that if they can't adequately do the work, they can be replaced."

    unlocks_affects: [warn_community_verifiers_2]
    feedback:
      centralize_control_over_travelling_nurses_2: "I'm wary of adding another level of bureaucracy to this, but it may help..."

  third_party_verifier: 
    dialogue: "The records filed by travelling nurses are sloppier and often late, since they are in the field instead of the hospital."
    unlocks: [require_nurses_to_return_to_file_2]
    unlocks_affects: [require_nurses_to_return_to_file_2]

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "We often do not hear that a nurse has been to visit a patient until after she is long gone, so it's difficult to verify everything."

    unlocks_affects: [increase_funding_for_verifiers_2]
    feedback:
      warn_community_verifiers_2: "We'll try to come up with a strategy to tackle this. It can't be insurmountable."

  clinic_manager:
    feedback:
      require_nurses_to_return_to_file_2: "Many of my facilities are not much better than the field, and it will add to our own filing burden."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "Our nurses are doing good work. If the Ministry can't confirm it's having an effect, then it's a verification issue."
