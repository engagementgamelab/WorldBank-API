initiating_dialogue: "Hello! Again, I must say I am very pleased to be working with you. My customers though, are less happy. They are reluctant to go to your hospitals even though I refer them. Couldn't you train someone here to do the work?"

    dialogue: "I really don't think that this is in my wheelhouse; maybe somebody else on your team would have a better idea?                "

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "I am not comfortable with procedures taking place by new workers and trainees unsupervised. I might approve stationing a nurse at traditional medicine facilities.   "

    unlocks_affects: [embed_nurses_1]

  coach:
    dialogue: "If they won't come to facilities, having trained people near them is better than nothing. Why not expand our outreach program instead, though?"
    unlocks: [expand_outreach_program_1]
    unlocks_affects: [expand_outreach_program_1]
    feedback:
      embed_nurses_1: "An interesting idea. I'll help facilitate this as best I can, It would be much easier to increase outreach staff, though.          "

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "Wow, uh, I'm not really sure what I would do in your shoes. That might be in somebody else's job description, though.       "

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "People are reluctant but I believe they could be swayed to come to facilities. I recommend keeping the program as it is."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "Sorry, I'm kind of up to my elbows in work here. I don't know if I have much advice to contribute to this situation.       "
    feedback:
      expand_outreach_program_1: "It will take some time to do this, and there is a shortage of qualified people, but I will do my best.             "

  health_provider_3:
    dialogue: "I really believe my clinic will be much more useful if someone here is trained to do the work.    "
    feedback:
      train_locals_1: "Excellent! I have a good feeling about you, friend.          "
      stick_to_the_plan_1: "I warn you, they will not accept it.                    "
