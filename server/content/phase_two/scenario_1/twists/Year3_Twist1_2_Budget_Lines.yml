    dialogue: "Our auditors have found mismanagement of funds. The providers need strict guidelines to provide the necessary services, and use the funds appropriately."
    narrows: [dep_minister_of_health, director_regional_health_services, coach, community_verifier]
    feedback: 
      clarification_of_roles_9: "This revision to the procurement guidelines is within the scope of regulation, which is my role. But if you think it's essential for the providers to keep autonomy, we will step back on this."

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "If the Ministry is claiming this is necessary, I would take it seriously. A compromise might be to re-work the RBF Manual, and training with Ministry oversight."
    unlocks: [revise_business_plan_4]
    unlocks_affects: [revise_business_plan_4]
    feedback:
      revise_business_plan_4: "It is a little late in the process to be doing this, but it's the only option that makes sense."

  coach:
    dialogue: "I have found some mismanagement of funds in the past as well, but appropriate actions were taken. We are supposed to be granting autonomy. Also, remember that the providers are paid for the services already provided."
    unlocks: [clarification_of_roles_9]
    unlocks_affects: [clarification_of_roles_9]
    feedback:
      comply_with_ministry_budget_1: "I don't believe this is the best option, but if you insist..."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "I don't understand the need for these new guidelines, but then again, I am not working in the hospital."

  third_party_verifier: 
    dialogue: "We are verifying the result and ensure that the providers get paid accurately. So why take away their autonomy?"

  health_provider_3:
    dialogue: "I do not know what the issue is, but this is making me look bad. I refer my customers to your facilities, and I hear back from them that there were no supplies there! This is what I told you about three years ago. It's why people don't trust you."
