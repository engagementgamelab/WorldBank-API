# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_wrong_procedures
tactic_name: unlockable_incentivise_providers_to_follow_protocols # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Wrong Procedures" # <--- display name for card
year: 1

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "Verifiers have identified that some patients are getting incorrect or unnecessary prescriptions. This could be a very serious problem."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "When patients require referral they often have insufficient funds to get there. Many doctors therefore prescribe or do whatever they can at their level instead of referring the patients to get the appropriate care elsewhere."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_create_robust_referral_system, unlockable_incentivise_following_set_protocols_rewards, unlockable_incentivise_referrals]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_create_robust_referral_system, unlockable_incentivise_following_set_protocols_rewards, unlockable_incentivise_referrals]

#
# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_create_robust_referral_system: "If the problem persists, then our providers are not leveling with us. It should fix the problem, though."
  unlockable_incentivise_following_set_protocols_rewards: "I get it's annoying to reward people for not breaking the rules, but if they feel the referral process is such a pain, that's what we have to do."
  unlockable_incentivise_referrals: "I hope we don't hear about unnecessary referrals next."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
