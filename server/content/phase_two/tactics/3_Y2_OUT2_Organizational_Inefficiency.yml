# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_organizational_inefficiency
tactic_name: unlockable_outreach  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Organizational Inefficiency" # <--- display name for card
year: 2

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The outreach team is not performing to the standards laid out in the program. The data shows they have not been working efficiently, and they've left many opportunities to deliver services on the table."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The explanation for the inefficiencies is that the staff is just too large. These are largely appointed people--not all of them are even qualified. And since incentives are being split among so many people, there is dissatisfaction with the level of incentive payments."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "Cutting staff would alleviate the problem, but it could cause political problems, since the appointments were made as part of an election. Simply paying more is another way to go."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_reduce_outreach_staff, unlockable_leave_things_as_is]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_reduce_outreach_staff, unlockable_leave_things_as_is]

further_options: [unlockable_increase_outreach_incentive_level]

further_options_affects: [unlockable_increase_outreach_incentive_level]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_reduce_outreach_staff: "This is a hard decision to make, but I think this will be better in the long run."
  unlockable_leave_things_as_is: "Not a bad idea. This could work itself out, especially if dissatisfied outreach workers step down."
  unlockable_increase_outreach_incentive_level: "This is an expensive choice, but I see the logic."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
