# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_inconclusive_metrics
tactic_name: unlockable_information_campaign_to_change_cultural_behaviors  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Transport Issues" # <--- display name for card
year: 2

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "Incentivizing community health workers to do an IEC on BCC for deliveries still doesn't appear to be having the effect we'd hoped for. It's not causing any harm but we also can't prove it is helping."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "Apart from cultural issues, it appears transport costs are preventing women from delivering in facilities. The health facilities seem to have some ideas for how address them."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_provide_family_transport_incentive, unlockable_end_campaign_t2, unlockable_leave_things_as_is_3]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_change_methodologies_t1, unlockable_end_campaign_t2, unlockable_leave_things_as_is_3]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_provide_family_transport_incentive: "This may work but will require some coordinating. Hope it will pay off!"
  unlockable_end_campaign_t2: "Leave it to the health facility to decide how they will attain the results."
  unlockable_leave_things_as_is_3: "We can wait it out a bit longer."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "If we don't engage it'll probably just fizzle out."
