# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_delayed_scores
tactic_name: unlockable_improve_patient_and_provider_relationship  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Delayed Scores" # <--- display name for card
year: 2

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The health facilities have been complaining that they are not receiving payments on time for their patient satisfaction scores. If they're not being paid on time, their staff might decide it's not worth doing any longer, and the program could fall apart."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "I checked with the Ministry of Finance, and this time it doesn't look like it's their fault. The community verifiers seem to be the bottleneck. They're not returning scores on time, which leads to delays. If payments were quarterly, this could give them some flexibility, but they may not be incentivized strongly enough to act. "

investigate_further_dialogue: "I interviewed some of the community verifiers, and they say that when they go to neighboring communities, it's hard to find patients' houses. Street addresses are missing in rural areas, and the road conditions are bad in Zariba, as you know. Contracting verifiers for each community would counteract this."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_incentivize_timely_scores, unlockable_shift_to_quarterly_basis_2]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_incentivize_timely_scores, unlockable_shift_to_quarterly_basis_2]

further_options_affects: [unlockable_hire_local_verifiers]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_incentivize_timely_scores: "This is a direct approach. I expect we'll see results soon."
  unlockable_shift_to_quarterly_basis_2: "This could give them the time they need to submit reports. Payments will at least be on time this way."
  unlockable_hire_local_verifiers: "This will be a logistical challenge, but it may be the only way to overcome these barriers."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
