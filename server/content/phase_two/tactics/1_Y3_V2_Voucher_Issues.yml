# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_voucher_issues
tactic_name: unlockable_vouchers_for_services # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Voucher Issues" # <--- display name for card
year: 3 

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The community verifier tells me they've seen eligible people looking for vouchers and not being able to get them. We should look into this."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "It seems that supply problems have been mostly solved, so it must be a distribution problem. They offered to put us in contact with another community organization to help distrubute these, we can inform the voucher agency. Another option would be to sanction the agency."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "There are community-based organizations in the concerned catchment area that the Voucher Agency could contract."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_contract_organization_to_help_distribute, unlockable_sanction_voucher_agency]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_contract_organization_to_help_distribute, unlockable_sanction_voucher_agency]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_contract_organization_to_help_distribute: "I'll get in touch with them and talk about establishing a contract with a Community-Based Organization."
  unlockable_sanction_voucher_agency: "I will advise the fund holder to withhold payment."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
