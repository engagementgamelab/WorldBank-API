# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_home_births
tactic_name: unlockable_outreach  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Home Births" # <--- display name for card
year: 3

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The outreach staff have been very successful over the past year! Providers are now asking if these outreach professionals can oversee home births to count them as facility births."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "This would make it much easier for us to hit our facility birth goals, but it goes against the plan. And according to our statistics, could be dangerous for women and their babies. "

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "Our investigation indicates that facilities don't have the capacity to see all the women that are now asking for services. Increasing incentives for these services could help boost capacity there."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_continue_with_plan, unlockable_give_permission]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_continue_with_plan, unlockable_give_permission]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_increase_facility_birth_incentives]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_increase_facility_birth_incentives]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_give_permission: "An interesting tactic."
  unlockable_continue_with_plan: "If they are pleased with the outreach program now, they will continue to be pleased going forward."
  unlockable_increase_facility_birth_incentives: "We can stimulate the collaboration between facilities and community."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
