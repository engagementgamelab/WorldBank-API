# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_raising_rates
tactic_name: unlockable_contract_private_company_to_deliver_supplies  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Raising Rates" # <--- display name for card
year: 3

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The shipping company we hired says they have to raise their rates starting at the next contract year."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "Our only options seem to be paying the new rate, which would have to come out of our discretionary budget, or trying to find a cheaper option."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "It seems that everyone's raising their rates, so switching companies won't help us much. We could attempt to negotiate the price down."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_pay_new_rate]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_pay_new_rate]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_negotiate]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_negotiate]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_pay_new_rate: "We'll have to get a little creative with the budget for this, but what else can we do?"
  unlockable_negotiate: "They wouldn't budge. Didn't hurt to try, though."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
