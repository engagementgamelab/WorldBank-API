# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_running_out_of_vouchers
tactic_name: unlockable_vouchers_for_services  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Running Out of Vouchers" # <--- display name for card
year: 3 

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "I'm getting reports that the Agency is running out of vouchers to give out. It could be a temporary shortage, or a systemic issue."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The printer is located in the Capital City, and they are overloaded by demand, and it takes too long for new shipments of printed vouchers to arrive. I could start looking for another printer. Or I could investigate whether they could be produced locally."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "It could be done at the local level with our cooperation. It would cost some money to set up a process in each region. "

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_seek_another_printer, unlockable_contract_multiple_printers]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_seek_another_printer, unlockable_contract_multiple_printers]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_print_vouchers_locally]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_print_vouchers_locally]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_seek_another_printer: "No other printers seems to be able to meet our demand. We could contract two printers to share the burden, but that would be a management challenge."
  unlockable_contract_multiple_printers: "I'll make the arrangements. It will be  a hassle dealing with two or more printers and distributors, but the benefits outweigh the downsides."
  unlockable_print_vouchers_locally: "I'll make the arrangements. With any luck, this will solve the shortage."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
