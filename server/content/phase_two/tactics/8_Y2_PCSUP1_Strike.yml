# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_strike
tactic_name: unlockable_contract_private_company_to_deliver_supplies  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Strike" # <--- display name for card
year: 2

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The private company we have hired to deliver medicine has gone on strike."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "There's no telling how long this strike could last. We need to find a temporary solution, at least, or look into more permenant alternatives."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "There is one other ground transport service we could use. There is also a new service that ships by air that would be more expensive, but could be more reliable."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_terminate_contract_at_end_of_year]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_terminate_contract_at_end_of_year]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_hire_another_ground_based_service, unlockable_hire_air_service]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_hire_another_ground_based_service, unlockable_hire_air_service]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_terminate_contract_at_end_of_year: "OK, we'll discuss this at the end of the year. The old way of doing things wasn't great, which is why we switched in the first place, but it'll work as until we can find a better solution."
  unlockable_hire_another_ground_based_service: "We probably should have gone with them first. We didn't because they're a little more expensive, but that's because they offer benefits and that sort of thing. They're less likely to strike."
  unlockable_hire_air_service: "This will cut deeper into our coffers, but they have a good track record."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
