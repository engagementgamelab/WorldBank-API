# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_infection_rates
tactic_name: unlockable_incentivise_providers_to_follow_protocols # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Infection Rates" # <--- display name for card
year: 2

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "There's been a sharp increase in infections recently and it's probably because the number of clients have increased significantly. There are more and more women delivering in the facility, but there are concerns about quality."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "Surprise! Sterilization protocols are not being followed and that's why women are getting these infections."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_incentivise_sanitization_protocols, unlockable_incentivise_best_practices, unlockable_sanction_providers_with_high_infection_rates]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_incentivise_sanitization_protocols, unlockable_incentivise_best_practices, unlockable_sanction_providers_with_high_infection_rates]


# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_incentivise_sanitization_protocols: "It smacks of gold star rewards for kids. 'Wash your hands, children!' Oh well. As long as it doesn't drain the discretionary budget too much."
  unlockable_incentivise_best_practices: "If we're going to increase the number of women delivering in the facility, we better make sure they receive quality care and not die because of it."
  unlockable_sanction_providers_with_high_infection_rates: "If staff can't be bothered to follow sterilization guidelines, then we are well within our rights to sanction them."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
