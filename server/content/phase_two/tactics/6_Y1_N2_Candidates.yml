# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "None of the hospitals or facilities have met their hiring goals for this quarter."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "There just aren't enough qualified people in the prescribed area to meet the hiring guidelines in the plan."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_widen_search_area, unlockable_lower_requirements_and_increase_training]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_widen_search_area, unlockable_lower_requirements_and_increase_training]


# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_widen_search_area: "We might have to pay people to relocate, but good staff is vital."
  unlockable_lower_requirements_and_increase_training: "Lowering requirements is going to come back and bite us unless we're very lucky."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
