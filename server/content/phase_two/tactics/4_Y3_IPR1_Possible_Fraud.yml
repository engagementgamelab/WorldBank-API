# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_possible_fraud
tactic_name: unlockable_improve_patient_and_provider_relationship  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Patient Satisfaction Not Improving" # <--- display name for card
year: 3

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "Good news and bad news. The good news is, scores are now being reported on time, and payments are being made. The bad news is, the patient satisfaction scores are not actually going up."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The health providers need to take action if they want to earn the full incentives on offer. The failure seems to be coming at the point of data analysis. Either the data itself is not sufficiently detailed, which means the community verifiers aren't doing their job, or the health providers just need to devote more time to data analysis."

investigate_further_dialogue: "The health providers want to make use of this data, but they just don't have the capacity. It's time we stepped in, if we ever want to see an improvement."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_retrain_verifiers_on_data, unlockable_retrain_providers_on_data]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_retrain_verifiers_on_data, unlockable_retrain_providers_on_data]


# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_retrain_verifiers_on_data: "I'll make sure this happens. Still, I wonder about the analysis side, and what the health providers may be missing."
  unlockable_retrain_providers_on_data: "Building capacity in this area will be sure to benefit them now and in the future. It's important to know how to read and analyze data to make improvements."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
