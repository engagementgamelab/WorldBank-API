# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_short_staff
tactic_name: unlockable_information_campaign_to_counter_misinformation  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "No Effect" # <--- display name for card
year: 1

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "According to providers, the campaign is struggling because they don't have the staff to both support the campaign and perform necessary health care functions. We could address this directly, either by funding new hires or increasing incentives, or we could halt the campaign for now to assess things."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "They do appear short staffed. Providing funding for new hires could help, or we could reoganize our sensitization strategy."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_provide_funding_to_hire_new_staff, unlockable_increase_incentives_for_meeting_campaign_goals, unlockable_reevaluate_whether_this_campaign_is_necessary]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_provide_funding_to_hire_new_staff, unlockable_increase_incentives_for_meeting_campaign_goals, unlockable_reevaluate_whether_this_campaign_is_necessary]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_provide_funding_to_hire_new_staff: "Everywhere I've worked we were short staffed and were told to make due. We're telling people to do a job and giving them the money to do it. We are in uncharted territory!"
  unlockable_increase_incentives_for_meeting_campaign_goals: "This could certainly spur people to meet goals. I'm worried, though, that they're spread thin already."
  unlockable_reevaluate_whether_this_campaign_is_necessary: "We might not need to spend all the money for this stuff, but if not useful, we should probably cut the plan at year's end."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
