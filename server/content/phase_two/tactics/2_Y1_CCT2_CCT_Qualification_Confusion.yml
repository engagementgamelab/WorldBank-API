# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_cct_qualification_confusion
tactic_name: unlockable_conditional_cash_transfer  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "CCT Qualification Confusion" # <--- display name for card
year: 1

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "There is some confusion on who qualifies for cash transfers. This is supposed to target the poorest people from the highlands, but according to reports some from the capital city and larger settlements have been requesting and receiving funds."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The policy itself seems to contain some ambiguities. A revision of the policy's inclusion/exclusion criterea could be the solution. I can look into hiring a third party to handle that. The policy also seems to be confusing to some workers. We could retrain them, and that might solve the problem."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "One of the hospital administrators has offered to revise the inclusion/exclusion policies to make it cearer for their staff. With our approval, of course. This would save us the cost of hiring a third party to revise them, if you trust the administrator to do it. "

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_retrain, unlockable_hire_third_party_to_rewrite]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_retrain, unlockable_hire_third_party_to_rewrite]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_hospital_administrator_revises_policy]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_hospital_administrator_revises_policy]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_retrain: "I'll instruct the facility managers to institute a mandatory retraining for all staff."
  unlockable_hire_third_party_to_rewrite: "We'll launch a bidding for a qualified third party right away."
  unlockable_hospital_administrator_revises_policy: "The Hospital Administrator will redefine the inclusion/exclusion criteria and bring clarity on required documents to be verified by the staff."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
