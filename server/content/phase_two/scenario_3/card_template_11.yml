  # The below blocks would contain each character that you can interact with (we'll enable/disable them based on the player's "inventory")
  dep_minister_of_health: # <--- character's symbol
    dialogue: "We are very interested in making sure the providers are doing what they say, and we have the staff available to review, so why not?"
    narrows: [third_party_verifier, coach] # <--- this probably will be a symbol
    feedback: 
      clarify_roles: "All right, I understand. I'll inform the staff here." # <--- symbol of the option used and the feedback text for it

  coach:
    dialogue: "Duplicating efforts seems to be hampering the health providers. I'd either clarify everyone's roles for them, or empower health providers to push back somehow."
    unlocks: [separation_of_rolls, authorize_push_back] # <--- these probably will symbols
    unlocks_affects: [example_1, example_2]

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "I didn't know about this. If the Ministry is doubling our verification efforts, it could prove very confusing to the providers."

  health_provider_1:
    dialogue: "Honestly, we've been ignoring the ministry's requests. We've got too much actual work to worry about."

    feedback:
      comply_with_ministry: "OK, we'll do our best."
      authorize_push_back: "OK I'll bring it up the next time they send in their request, but they can be very firm."
