  # The below blocks would contain each character that you can interact with (we'll enable/disable them based on the player's "inventory")
  dep_minister_of_health: # <--- character's symbol
    dialogue: "The delay is in our verification, unfortunately. The health team on the ground responsible for the first level of verification has many responsibilities. If it is that important maybe the providers should just be paid."

  director_regional_health_services: # <--- character's symbol
    dialogue: "The Deputy Minister is correct, the regional team has many responsibilities and looking at figures is not necessarily the priority"
    feedback: 
      introduce_incentives_for_timely_verification: "This will certainly make it the teamsâ€™ priority. The incentives can also be used to strengthen the team with extra resources to help ensure verification is done in time."

  coach:
    dialogue: "It is important that verification is done prior to payment. A solution may be to Incentivise the regional team to do the first-level verification in a timely manner."
    unlock: [introduce_incentives_for_timely_verification]
    unlock_affects: [introduce_incentives_for_timely_verification]
    feedback:
      request_payment_without_verification_5: "This does not set a good precedent I think but of course it is not my decision."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "You understand that if there is no first-level of verification, there is nothing for us to verify, right?"

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "The Ministry takes forever to do anything. They need to be prodded, I think. It is important this is done in a timely manner."

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "I like working with the government, I do. But doubling verification doubles the time before I get my money, and my budget is pretty tight as it is."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "Having three levels of verification sounds like overkill to me. And my staff is confused about who's actually in charge."
