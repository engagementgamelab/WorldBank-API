initiating_dialogue: "I'm disappointed to say this, but things are not going well. Providers routinely miss goals, and our indicators have not risen as predicted. We're thinking about declaring the plan DOE and cancelling it for next year. This would mean a return to traditional financing."

    dialogue: "As much as it pains me to say so, I agree with the Deputy Minister. We need to change tactics."

    dialogue: "There must be another solution here. I'm committed to making this plan work. Even with new health providers taking on contracts."

      return_to_traditional_financing: "Part of me feels like the past three years have been wasted, but I guess there's no sense in throwing good money out after bad. It's been a pleasure working with you." # <--- symbol of the option used and the feedback text for it

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "I'm seeing some good done at the ground level, but I have no idea how that reflects nationally."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "I can tell you that, if the problems I keep seeing in paperwork are any indication, you're in trouble. Then again, filling out forms and caring for patients aren't the same thing."

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "My clinics could handle this better if you shifted some resources away from the hospital and to my network. Hire another contractor to fill the gaps and let me do my job."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "I heard through the grapevine what's happening. I know there have been issues, but I believe the problem is and has been beurocracy from the Ministry's offices. If you grant us autonomy to hire staff as needed and order supplies to fill our patients' needs, things have to improve."
