    dialogue: "The clinic managers may just be late in their requests. If needs be we can improve the guidance for approval processes to see if it can be faster. New technology could play a role maybe."

  coach:
    feedback: 
      improve_guidance_on_approval_processes: "I will get onto this. Hope it will make a difference. Granting the providers autonomy may be an easier way to fix it."
      retrain_staff_on_business_plan: "I will be happy to have another round of trainings but I think the problem may lie elsewhere."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "It seems this hospital has not been able to increase their performance very well."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "I would talk directly to them if I were you. Maybe they're seeing something we aren't."

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "If only we were able to decide and use the resources as we see fit. This would help us carry out our activities and improve performance."

    feedback: 
      grant_autonomy_to_providers_2: "This will really help. I am so excited as now we can make a real difference to get the people the health services they need."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "We're doing our best here. There are many intricacies to the business plan, and not everyone on my staff understands them. Maybe the coach can help retrain them."
