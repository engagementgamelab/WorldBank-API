  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "You should talk to the Hospital Administrator: they're working under similar conditions and should have insight. Run it by your RBF Coach, too."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "We have had a similar problem here. And since you mention it, granting us the autonomy to make staff changes ourselves would go a long way to fix this. "
