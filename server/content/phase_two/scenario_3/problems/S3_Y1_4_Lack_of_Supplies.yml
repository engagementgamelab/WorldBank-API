    dialogue: "If people are being turned away, it's because funds are being mismanaged. Sanctioning them may be the only thing that providers will pay attention to."

    unlocks_affects: [unlocks_sanction_providers]

  director_regional_health_services: # <--- character's symbol
    dialogue: "This is a serious problem. Even if services were abundant, it's hard to get people to come to the hospital."
    feedback: 
      increase_supply_budget: "We've increased the budget every year and that hasn't solved the problem yet. That isn't to say our health care providers are the problem, only that it might not be budgetary." # <--- symbol of the option used and the feedback text for it

  coach:
    dialogue: "I'm not sure why, but these facilities are always low on supplies. Maybe they just need more money."
    unlocks: [increase_supply_budget]
    unlocks_affects: [increase_supply_budget]
    feedback: 
      grant_facilities_autonomy: "I'll see to this. In addition, we should issue a recommendation to the Ministry about the usefulness of autonomy in these facilities in general, as this is clearly not well-understood." # <--- symbol of the option used and the feedback text for itA

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "The numbers are poor, but at least the facilities are being honest about it."

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "I've spoken to the RBF coach about this a number of times. If we don't have basic supplies, we cannot treat patients."
    narrows: [dep_minister_of_health, director_regional_health_services, clinic_manager, third_party_verifier, community_verifier] # <--- this probably will be a symbol
    feedback: 
      unlocks_sanction_providers: "You can't seriously be asking us to do more with even less. It costs money to provide quality care." # <--- symbol of the option used and the feedback text for it

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "We put in requests for supplies, but it's forever before they're filled. And when they do, we get too much of some things, and not enough of others. If we could simply order or purchase our own supplies directly, this wouldn't be a problem, but the Ministry says what we're allowed to get down to the last syringe."
