  director_regional_health_services: # <--- character's symbol

    feedback: 
      increase_supply_budget: "We've increased the budget every year and that hasn't solved the problem yet. That isn't to say our health care providers are the problem, only that it might not be budgetary." # <--- symbol of the option used and the feedback text for it

  clinic_manager:

    feedback: 
      unlocks_sanction_providers: "You can't seriously be asking us to do more with even less. It costs money to provide quality care." # <--- symbol of the option used and the feedback text for it

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "We put in requests for supplies, but it's forever before they're filled. And when they do, we get too much of some things, and not enough of others. If we could simply order our own supplies directly, this wouldn't be a problem, but the Ministry says what we're allowed to get down to the last syringe."

    unlocks_affects: [grant_facilities_autonomy]
    feedback:
