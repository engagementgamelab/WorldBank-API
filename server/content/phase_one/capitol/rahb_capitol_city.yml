    Initial:
      text: 
        - "Welcome to Zariba! I hope you've had some time to yourself in the Capitol City to get your bearings, but of course, you are here to work. You will [[make a program]] that will transform our health system over the next four years, but to figure out what should be in that program, you will need to explore the country and [[talk to people]]."
        - "I still have more to tell you!"
    Make a Program: 
      text: 
        - "\"You can use your notebook to keep track of where you have been, what you have learned, and what options seem to make sense for your program. The icon to open your notebook is on the lower left of your screen.\""
    Talk to People: 
      text: 
        - "\"In each area you visit, you will be able to talk to people just like you are talking to me, by clicking and spending conversation points. Your time in each city is limited though, so choose whom you talk to wisely. I have taken the liberty of setting up a meeting with the Deputy Minister of Health, the Finance Minister, and the Regional Director of Health Services for the Highlands Region. It is starting now! They are on the other side of the table to your right. Click on them to talk.\""
