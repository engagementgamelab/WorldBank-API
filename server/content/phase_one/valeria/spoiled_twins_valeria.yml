        - "They stare at you for a moment when you approach, then ask who you are. When you explain yourself, they are happy to share their opinions on Zariba's health care system. \n\"The highlands are where all the poor people live,\" the brother says.\n\"He knows that,\" his sister interrupts. \"Everyone knows that. We were both born here in Valeria, in our own house. No one likes to go to these hospitals. They're so ugly.\"\n\"I've been in one. They just feel dirty, and they smell. And the staff look like street people,\" the brother agrees. \"That's why no one wants to go to them.\""
