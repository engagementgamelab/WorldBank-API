# Phase One Dialogue YAML
# ==============

# A character interactable
symbol: dialogue_nomad_valeria
character: nomad_valeria

# DIALOGUE FORMAT:
# - Initial: First dialogue player sees after reading character_description. This text is a multiline array, where the first string is what player sees before completing any of this character's dialogue tree, and the second and third is text they'll see subsequent to reach the end of the first and second trees.
# ====> Use double-bracket notation for words or phrases that, if tapped, unlock subsequent tree 
#       -- e.g. [[this]] will open the "This" dialogue option
# - This: "this" dialogue tree
#   unlocks: [route_to_kibari] <-- this is a symbol stored in "unlockables.yml", so its display text can be easily tweaked globally.

Land Barons have been building palaces out of sand for hundreds of years here. Not sure how they get the sand to hold together, but it seems to work. The airships are new, though. Got to change with the times.\""
