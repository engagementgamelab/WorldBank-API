        - "He does not seem particularly bothered by your presence, and puts the magazine on his lap to speak with you. After a few minutes of idle conversation, he volunteers a little more about his past. \"I was not from here originally,\" he says. \"I came here as a refugee many years ago, back during the old regime. It was a very [[difficult journey]].\" A frown spreads across his face. \"My village was destroyed by a [[landslide]] during a rain storm. It will never be rebuilt. The government doesn't want to spend money on this because they happen so often, so people just move.\""
        - "He looks up from his magazine to greet you. \"Nice to see you again. Did you want to discuss something with me?\""

        - "\"Some people miss the old regime,\" he says, \"They were very nationalistic, but they never did anything for me, you know? I have lived through a lot, and democracy seems much better than the alternative.\" He fans himself with the news magazine and finishes his thought. \"Some people disagree, and wish they could go back. But most don't care. I would ignore the nationalist claptrap that some spout.\""

        - "\"It was so terrible,\" he says. \"Unless you have seen one, it is hard to describe. The entire village was just gone. Many people died. I lost family members. I feel lucky that I was able to make it here, and was accepted and given hospitality. There were some NGOs that helped refugees settle, as people here do not have much. They gave all they could and more.\""

        - "He nods and explains how travel is very difficult unless you can afford to buy a train ticket. \"And few can! If you can't afford a ticket, you must walk along the tracks, and it is very dangerous, takes days of walking. Recently, someone died making the trip to Zima, and now no one even tries it unless they are desperate, you know? Just last month, a woman died giving birth and she couldn't make it to the hospital in time. Later, the husband was told that if the woman had come for antenatal care visits, the issue could have been detected and prevented.\""
