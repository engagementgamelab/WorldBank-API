        - "A look of suspicion comes over his face for a moment, but it is quickly replaced with the same smile from before. \"Greetings!\" he says. \"Yes, it is true. I am Mr. Todd.\" You recognize the name. \"I would not claim to be the [[best medicine man]] in Zariba, but if that is what they say, that is [[what they say]]!\" He gives you a knowing nod. \"As for you, I know who you are. You're here working with the Ministry, coming to promote their useless clinics.\""
        - "Mr. Todd smirks at you as you return. \"Still here, hmm? What more do you want me to say?\""

        - "He chuckles. \"People come to me because I am already a part of their lives. Part of their community! The hospitals and clinics you want people to visit are not good. The nurses and doctors treat you like a stranger. No, like an interloper. An annoyance. They do not care about people like I do. My patients are always satisfied.\""

I heard some folks saying they believe hospitals are a trick to take our money and make us sicker! I don't know how those get started. People say what they say,\" he reiterates."

      unlocks_context: ["There seems to be some misinformation circulating about poor-quality services from hospitals that dissuade people from using them. An information campaign could counter this."]

      display_name: "Ask about clinics"
      text: 
        - "\"That's right! I say useless. Why would a person travel to see a doctor who can't even give them medicine? Ask your doctors that. Meanwhile, you come to me, you leave with medicine in hand. Even better, my cures are distributed far and wide.\""
