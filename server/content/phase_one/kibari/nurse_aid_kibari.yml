    Availibility of Supplies: 
      text: 
        - "She responds, \"I am frequently running out of supplies, the medical supply department in the capitol is never sending me the supplies I am requesting in a timely manner. The buffer drug stock gets finished every time before getting the new supplies. For example, I run out of vaccines and syringes all the time. I am sure you heard of the recent measles outbreak? I also do not have basic medicines and supplies to treat patients. If I had the resources I could buy the supplies I need here in Kibari.\""

    Work in her Clinic:
      text:
        - "\"I see many patients, but it is also very frustrating as I can't be in the clinic all day. I have to work two jobs to make ends meet for my family as a nurse aid in the government health system. I don't get paid enough. Incentives would help me spend more time delivering services.\""
