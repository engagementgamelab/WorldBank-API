#       -- e.g. [[this]] will open the "This" dialogue option
# - This: "this" dialogue tree
#   unlocks: [route_to_kibari] <-- this is a symbol stored in "unlockables.yml", so its display text can be easily tweaked globally.

        - "When you approach him, his eyes light up. \"What can I do for you?\" he asks. \"Anything you need, I have it.\" You buy some sweets from him out of politeness, and after that he seems happy to share what he knows about the area. \"The nearest cities to here are [[Crup]] and [[Mile]]. Both easy enough to get to. I'm actually on my way to [[Zima]]."
        - "\"Anything else you need?\" he asks, watching as you approach."
    Mile: 
      text:
        - "You ask about Mile, and he offers some advice. \"In Mile, no one has any money at all, but it is on the route to the capitol city, so I pass through from time to time. If you want to get there, just hop on one of the produce trucks that makes the rounds from here to there. They leave pretty frequently.\""
