      text: 
        - "At first, he seems too engrossed in the chart to devote his full attention to you, but once you introduce yourself, he puts it down and apologizes. \"I wish I had time for a formal sit down with you,\" he says, \"but time is tight around here. I will try to share as much as I can. This hospital works very well [[for the rich]], since they can afford whatever tests and procedures we order, but [[poor people]] tend to shy away from us, which is a shame.\""
        - "Dr. Notega seems a little overwhelmed, but he pauses in his work to talk to you. \"Anything else you want to know? I am happy to talk while I have a little time.\""
    Poor People: 
      text: 
        - "You ask more about the poor people of the highlands and he gives a frustrated shrug. \"The majority of people in the highlands have no money. They can not afford basic care like deliveries. Even if they could, I am not sure they would purchase it.\""
      unlocks: [unlockable_vouchers_for_services]
      unlocks_context: ["Dr. Notega says only the rich can afford to deliver in his hospital."]
    For The Rich:
      text:
        - "\"I admit, we mainly provide services for our affluent customers. We deliver quality services, so running a hospital is expensive. If the government were incentivizing us to deliver the same services for the poor, we would be able to do so.\""
      unlocks: [unlockable_incentivise_providers_to_deliver_services]
      unlocks_context: ["At the hospital, services that 'keep the lights on' are prescribed. We could incentivise the services we need delivered."]

      text:
        - "You ask about the supply issues his friend told you about back in the train station. \"Yes, there are serious supply issues, but the problem is not the train. It is our budget. The hospital administrator can tell you all about this, I am sure.\""
