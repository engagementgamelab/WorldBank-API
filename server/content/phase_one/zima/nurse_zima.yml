dialogue:
    Initial:
      text: 
        - "Once you get him talking, the nurse seems almost relieved to have someone to complain to. \"I work harder than anyone in this facility, but compared the doctors, I get paid practically nothing! I deal with [[angry people]] every day. He just writes [[prescriptions]].\""
        - "The nurse motions for you to come back over to him. \"Listen to me, and I will tell you how things really are,\" he says."
    Angry People: 
      text: 
        - "The tall nurse crosses his arms. \"They get angry when I tell them they must go to the drugstore. They don't understand anything. They think the hospital is a pharmacy. They ask stupid questions. I get tired of it. You've never heard of a drugstore? And then when the pharmacy does not have the drugsâ€¦ That is my fault TOO?\""
      unlocks: [unlockable_improve_patient_and_provider_relationship]
      unlocks_context: ["Nurses are clearly over-stressed, and provide poor service."]
    Prescriptions:
      text:
        - "\"Yeah, patients aren't happy unless they leave with a prescription in hand. Lucky for the doctors, they can just write them. Then it's me who has to try and fill it. I've seen antibiotics prescribed for viruses, or even for nothing at all, just because it's the only medicine we always have in stock.\""
      unlocks: [unlockable_incentivise_providers_to_follow_protocols]
      unlocks_affects: ["According to the nurse, doctors are prescribing medicine for the wrong reasons."]
