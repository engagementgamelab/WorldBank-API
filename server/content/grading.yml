# Grading Definitions
# ==============

# This screen should show the number difference between your starting indicator scoreand your ending indicator score, The grade of your plan, and some copy (2-4 sentences) that gives an overview of what happened/will happen (these should also link up to the scenario that might be coming with each plan and can be based off 
# those major choices + how well the plan did grade wise). eventually they will be infographics, but for now lets just use numbers and some generic art.

# Indicators: These are static numbers that will guide the player in knowing where the country starts, where they are at after phase 1, where they begin in phase 2, and what their ultimate results are at the end of phase 2.

# Every beginning of phase 1 starts the same way with the same indicator numbers on average over the course of the year. 


# Rationale: we want to guide the player into thinking that the problem is about the services having potential to be there, but the people are 1. being swayed from using them because of traditional medicine and 2. hospitals aren't given enough autonomy which results in the lack of services/quality when patients do go. The low vaccinations/facility births should clue the player into thinking that there is a supply problem.

# There are four possible grades you can get for your plan.

- score: 14-12
  grade: A
  description: "Congratulations on exceeding expectations! The pilot test has shown significant increases in all three indicators. We are confident that over the next three years, this program will continue to bear fruit."
  default_affects: [10, 12, 20]
  affects_bias: [-2, -1, -2]

- score: 11-9
  grade: B
  description: "The pilot test shows some promising results. We have seen measurable increases in all three indicators, especially in quality of care. Perhaps on another return to the region you should visit different cities and speak to different people to get a better picture of the whole situation. Still, with proper implementation over the next three years, facility births and vaccinations could rise. "
  default_affects: [7, 10, 15]
  affects_bias: [-1, -2, -1]

- score: 8-6
  grade: C
  description: "The results of our pilot test were mixed to say the least. Indicators have slightly increased, but we expected better numbers at this point in the process. Perhaps on another return to the region you should visit different cities and speak to different people. Still, monitoring this RBF program effectively could yield impressive results in the future."
  default_affects: [5, 5, 7]
  affects_bias: [-2, -1, -2]

- score: 6-1
  grade: D
  description: "Pilot test results were not as impressive as we would have liked. We will save this program proposal in our system, but recommend re-evaluation of the context. Perhaps on another return to the region you should visit different cities and speak to different people. A second attempt could yield a program with greater efficacy." 
  default_affects: [2, 4, 4]
  affects_bias: [-2, -2, -3]

- score: 0-0
  grade: F
  description: "Our results show that this is doing more harm than good. Achieving indicator goals by year 4 with this program will be difficult. We highly recommend constructing a new program or implementing another RBF specialist's program. Perhaps on another return to the region you should visit different cities and speak to different people."
  default_affects: [0, 0, 0]
