      text: "As you approach they both turn to eye you up and down, and you feel a sense of being judged by your attire. They turn back to each other smirking, continuing their conversation. \n\"This market was fun for an hour or so, but I just cannot wait to be back at the estate. Did you hear? Uncle will be renovating the outer sand gardens to make space for three new horses!\"\n The second woman smiles. \"That sounds lovely. Hopefully next spring he’ll finally put in that airship tether he’s always going on about. What time is it, dear? The ferry should be here soon!\""
