All of our products are 100% derived from the land itself, and we never use any ingredients of foreign origin. Our medicine is the only cure that has been proven by centuries of practice here in Zariba. We are headquartered in [[Kibari]], so all our products are checked for authenticity by [[Mr. Todd]] himself!\""
