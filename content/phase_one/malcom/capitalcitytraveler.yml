    Initial:
      text: "After a few attempts of getting her attention, she tells you how she has been waiting for hours for the next train out of the station. \"There have been two trains heading to Mile that have already been cancelled!\" Flustered, she mutters under her breath about being late to meet her friend.\""
    Mile: 
      text: "You ask her about Mile, and she tells you she has never been there. \"I just need to pass through on the way to visit my friend.\""
    Arrival Time: 
      text: "You learn she is attempting to head to Zema, the southern city on the water, to visit her friend who is a doctor at the largest hospital there. \"We are very close, and since he has been frustrated with his job, I want to help him have a little fun for a few days. Apparently he hasn’t been receiving supplies, or so he says.\"  She raises her arms in exasperation. \"This accursed train! If medical supplies don’t even reach the hospital, what are my chances?\""
