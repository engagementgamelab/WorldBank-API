    Initial:
      text: 
        - "After a few attempts of getting her attention, she tells you how she has been waiting for hours for the next train out of the station. \"There have been two trains heading to Mile that have already been [[cancelled]]!\" Flustered, she mutters under her breath about being late to meet [[her friend]].\""
        - "She's finished with her phone call now, and it's easy to get her attention again."
    cancelled: 
      text: 
        - "She nods, looking unhappy. \"Unfortunately, this happens all too often. The train has been the main way both people and goods move through the country for longer than I can remember. But it is unreliable.\""
      unlocks: [unlockable_contract_private_company_to_deliver_supplies]
      unlocks_context: ["You learned from a traveller that most goods move by train, but the train is unreliable. A private company could avoid this problem."]

      text: 
        - "You learn she is attempting to head to Zima, the southern city on the water, to visit her friend Doctor Notega at the hospital there. \"We are very close, and since he has been frustrated with his job, I want to help him have a little fun for a few days. Apparently he has not been receiving supplies, or so he says. If you go there, ask him, and I am  sure he will tell you all about it.\""
      unlocks: [unlockable_dialogue_dr_notega]
      unlocks_context: ["Doctor Notega in Zima will know more about this."]
