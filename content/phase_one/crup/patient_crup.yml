# ====> Use double-bracket notation for words or phrases that, if tapped, unlock subsequent tree 
#       -- e.g. [[this]] will open the "This" dialogue option
# - This: "this" dialogue tree
#   unlocks: [route_to_kibari] <-- this is a symbol stored in "unlockables.yml", so its display text can be easily tweaked globally.

        - "The woman looks a bit exasperated, and not in the best health. When you ask her about her experience with the clinic, she offers a mostly [[negative account]]. \"We are lucky to have a clinic nearby at all,\" she says. \"But there are long waits here, and the clinic is very poor. I blame [[government incompetence]].\""
        - "She looks happy to see you again. Apparently she enjoyed sharing her experiences. \"No one has ever asked me my opinions about something so important before.\""
    Negative Account:
      text:
        - "\"The rest would all be tolerable if the people at the hospitals and clinics were at least polite and helpful, but they are not. They treat us like a nuisance when they talk to us at all.\""
