      text: "You stand a little closer and are able to hear their conversation. \"Damn arthritis,\" one says, grabbing at a tile.\nThe other replies, \"You should visit Kibari and see Mr. Todd. Best medicine man in Zariba!\"\n\"I know,\" the first man says, placing his piece on the board. \"You keep saying. I might try it. The doctor at the clinic gave me some ointment and it did nothing. He told me to go to the hospital for some test, but that's all the way in Zima.\"\n\"Trucks go back and forth to Kibari every day...\" the first man says.\n\"Itâ€™s your move,\" the other grumbles."
