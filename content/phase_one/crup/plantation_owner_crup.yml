# DIALOGUE FORMAT:
# - Initial: First dialogue player sees after reading character_description. This text is a multiline array, where the first string is what player sees before completing any of this character's dialogue tree, and the second and third is text they'll see subsequent to reach the end of the first and second trees.
# ====> Use double-bracket notation for words or phrases that, if tapped, unlock subsequent tree 
#       -- e.g. [[this]] will open the "This" dialogue option
# - This: "this" dialogue tree
#   unlocks: [[route_to_kibari]] <-- this is a symbol stored in "unlockables.yml", so its display text can be easily tweaked globally.
