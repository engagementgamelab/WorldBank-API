        - "As you step closer, she stops what she is doing and looks at you askance. \"Not that I am not thankful for an excuse to rest and talk,\" she says, \"but I have a lot of work to do. This harvest will feed my [[family]], and others in the village.\" There is a hint of [[pride]] in her voice."
        - "The farm worker hums to herself. When she sees you approach, she pauses. \"Back again?\""
    Family: 
      text: 
        - "\"I have two sons and a daughter, a husband and a brother,\" she explains. When you ask about their health care, she shrugs, looking a little guilty. \"I barely have time to do what needs doing here, you know? Between doing my work and taking care of basic needs, who has time to think about health care, let alone visit a hospital? Taking care of basics like food and water, and a roof that does not leak is far more important. Besides, some people are scared of the hospitals.\""

      unlocks_context: ["People are more concerned with leaking roofs than vaccines. Offering a credit for a new roof at clinics could bring patients in."]
    Pride: 
      text: 
        - "\"I guess I am proud of it,\" she smiles. \"My family has farmed this land for generations. Soon my children will be old enough to contribute, and carry our family on to the next generation. This makes me very happy. It's not just about feeding ourselves. This isn't some plantation like Crup. We work for ourselves here. Money's just not that important to us.\""
