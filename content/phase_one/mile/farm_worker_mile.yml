        - "As you step closer, she stops what she is doing and looks at you with some suspicion. \"Not that I am not thankful for an excuse to rest and talk,\" she says, \"but I have a lot of work to do. This harvest will feed my [[family]], and others in the village.\" There is a hint of [[pride]] in her voice."
        - "The farm worker hums to herself. When she sees you approach, she pauses. \"Back again?\""
    Family: 
      text: 
        - "\"I have two sons and a daughter, a husband and a brother,\" she explains. When you ask about their health care, particularly whether her children have been immunized, she shrugs, looking a little guilty. \"I barely have time to do what needs doing here, you know? Between doing my work and taking care of basic needs, who has time to think about health care, let alone visit a clinic? Taking care of basics like food and water, and a roof that does not leak is far more important. I have heard that the government is introducing a welfare program for people like me. That will help, but I still don't see the purpose of going to a health facility to vaccinate my children when they are not sick.\""

    Pride: 
      text: 
        - "\"I guess I am proud of it,\" she smiles. \"My family has farmed this land for generations. Soon my children will be old enough to contribute, and carry our family on to the next generation. This makes me very happy. It's not just about feeding ourselves. This isn't some plantation like Crup. We work for ourselves here and value the way that we connect with the land as we have done for generations.\""
