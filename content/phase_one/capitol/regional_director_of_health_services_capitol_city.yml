    Initial:
      text: 
        - "Thank you again for coming all the way here. Your expertise is much appreciated. Our health system has been drastically underperforming despite our best efforts. Our mortality rates for children under five are unacceptable. \n We have identified three indicators to address to improve these numbers: Vaccinations, Facility Births, and Quality of Care. We have pushed facilities to improve on these indicators, but so far the results have been underwhelming. First and foremost, I recommend that you find a way to boost these key services and quality indicators."

      unlocks_context: ["The Deputy Minister of Health says facilities are not providing enough of these services. If they are incentivised to provide more, they probably will."]
