        - "The Regional Director speaks up. \"I have been trying to improve the health system in the Highlands region for a few years now, but there are [[many obstacles]]. The main referral hospital is in Zima which is far from the highlands and has its own [[logistical problems]]. If we want to improve the health of the people in Zariba, we need to start in the highlands, but there are many obstacles and much [[confusion]]. The situation is not good, and we lag behind the rest of the country, and our neighbors,\" he says. \"More than 80% of the people in the highlands live in extreme poverty, and cannot purchase even basic health services."

    Logistical Problems:
