  display_name: Medicine Merchant
  description: "In the middle of the crowded marketplace, you see a man dressed in an impressive garb that feels important and professional, but at once authentic and grounded.

The sign reads \"Medicine\" in multiple languages."

  display_name: Women Waiting for Ferry
  description: "At the far end of the market there are two women in elaborate dress. You don’t know where they are from, but they are certainly not from this region, nor do they look like they came from Capitol City. Very ornamental and expensive, their dresses pop and glide in different directions and both are wearing wild headpieces. You feel a sense of royalty from them."
