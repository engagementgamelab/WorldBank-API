initiating_npc: dep_minister_of_health # <--- character's symbol
initiating_dialogue: "The independent verifier and the health providers seem to have built a coalition to box us out of the verification process. This program gives us the authority to verify any and all reports, but they're pushing back."

    feedback:
      ask_reduce_oversight: "This isn't what we had in mind when we started the project. I don't see how we can, in good faith, approve costs we haven't verified."

  director_regional_health_services: # <--- character's symbol
    dialogue: "We need the authority to verify like we always have. It seems unethical to OK payments that we haven't verified."
    feedback:
      streamline_speed_verification_process: "This will put some strain on our office, but I think we can get the extra work done."

  coach:
    dialogue: "The program spreads authority across multiple stakeholders, including the Ministry of Health. Whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, that's their concern. Let's send a memo gently reminding everyone of that."

    feedback: 
      circulate_memo_reaffirming_ministry_authority: "I'll make sure this gets into everyone's mailbox as a high priority. Don't worry: I won't write the subject in caps lock again."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "It's my job to verify reports. Having someone else double everything we're doing is worse than redundant: it's counter-productive."

    unlocks_affects: [ask_reduce_oversight]
    feedback:
      warn_verifier_1: "All right. We'll let everyone look over our shoulders all they want. But to say it's inefficient is an understatement."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "We're tired of submitting our reports in triplicate. We have enough to do without all this paperwork."

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "I like working with the government, I do. But doubling verification doubles the time before I get my money, and my budget is pretty tight as it is."

    unlocks_affects: [streamline_speed_verification_process]

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "Having three levels of verification sounds like overkill to me. And my staff is confused about who's actually in charge."
