    dialogue: "The plan's faltering a bit. Are you sure this is the hospital's administrator's fault and not some issue with the business plan? It might be on us."

      sanctions_11: "Alright, but I think this is a little much for so early in the game. I'll keep an eye out and maybe we can avoid this happening." # <--- symbol of the option used and the feedback text for it

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "You hired us to verify reports. Having a separate body double everything we're doing is worse than redundant. It's counter-productive."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "We're tired of submitting our reports in triplicate. The work we do is hard enough without all this paperwork."

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "I like working with the government, I do. But doubling verification doubles the time before I get my money, and my budget is pretty tight as it is."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "Having three levels of verification sounds like overkill to me. And my staff is confused about who's actually in charge."
