    dialogue: "Quality of care is important insofar as it enables better and more services to be delivered. It might be that the clinic is delivering as much good care as they can given their circumstances."

  director_regional_health_services: # <--- character's symbol
    dialogue: "I recognize that their job is difficult, but quality of care is one of the indicators we are working to improve."

  coach:
    dialogue: "Quality of care is not something we should grant leeway on. It is crucially important. If they are under such strain, they may require extra staff."

      review_the_inspection_2: "I will coordinate this review, but I still think they need to stick to the business plan."
