initiating_dialogue: "I've been interviewing patients as part of the quality assessment, and at least in one clinic there's a serious quality of care issue. People have been leaving with what appears to be a lot of medicines - 3 drugs on average for something as simple as a flu seems a bit much."

    dialogue: "We must conduct an investigation right away. Begin by speaking directly with the clinic manager and find out why this is happening. We may need to explore if the problem exists in other facilities too."

  coach:
    dialogue: "Maybe we've been incentivising the wrong things by incentivising patient satisfaction. Prescriptions make patients happy, whether or not they're correct. Maybe staff prioritized satisfied patients -- perhaps to the detriment of best practices."

  community_verifer:
    dialogue: "The patients have told me they are happy so I thought this was good news?"

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "I have a lot of challenges and unfortunately I can't be everywhere at once. In the end, I am responsible, but I feel I am not being given the support I need as we have too few staff and many of them not well qualified."
    feedback: 
      warning_16: "You're asking me to discipline my clinics for avoiding fights with patients who think medicine means walking out with a bottle of pills. I also have to discipline them for not making patients happy. I'll try to figure out some way to balance those." # <--- symbol of the option used and the feedback text for it
      sanctions_15: "You cut our funds when patients complain, which they do because we don't prescribe them drugs. Then, when we give them what they want, you cut our funds again. You need to figure out what you want." # <--- symbol of the option used and the feedback text for it

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "At first I was shocked to hear this, but the more I thought about it, the more it makes sense. Patients don't know the difference, and if you're incentivising happy patients, the wrong medicine is better than no medicine."
