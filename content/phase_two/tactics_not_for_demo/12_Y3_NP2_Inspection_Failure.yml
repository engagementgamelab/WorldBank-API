# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_inspection_failure
tactic_name: unlockable_incentivise_providers_to_follow_protocols # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Inspection Failure" # <--- display name for card
year: 3

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "Our third party verifier tells me some facilities have failed their safety inspections this quarter. I have some unverified horror stories, but even if they aren't true, anything close to that is alarming."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "They seem to be concentrating only on meeting goals, so while no one, thank God, is reusing syringes, people are getting over-prescribed, injected, etc, to reach quotas."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_incentivise_best_practices_long_term, unlockable_sanction_providers_who_fail_safety_inspection]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_incentivise_best_practices_long_term, unlockable_sanction_providers_who_fail_safety_inspection]


# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_incentivise_best_practices_long_term: "There's no excuse for this: there are plenty of people to treat. We have to nip this in the bud."
  unlockable_sanction_providers_who_fail_safety_inspection: "It's going to cost some money to make best practices possible, but it makes sense long-term."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
