# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_fraud_alert
tactic_name: unlockable_improve_patient_and_provider_relationship_not_selected  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Fraud Alert" # <--- display name for card
year: 3

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "There has been an increase in fraudulent service claims since the first year."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "It seems that when we raised incentives near the end of the first year, this tempted some providers to file fraudulent claims."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_sanction_these_providers, unlockable_cut_incentives, unlockable_cancel_contracts]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_sanction_these_providers, unlockable_cut_incentives, unlockable_cancel_contracts]


# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_sanction_these_providers: "This is probably more cost effective, since everyone should get in line after a little punishment. And that's cheaper than finding new providers."
  unlockable_cut_incentives: "They're already stealing from us, basically. Smaller scores probably won't do much to ameliorate that."
  unlockable_cancel_contracts: "This will create a lot of work for us, but I understand these hospitals abused your trust. If patients suffer too, it is the providers' fault."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
