# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_waiting
tactic_name: unlockable_incentivise_providers_to_follow_protocols # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Waiting" # <--- display name for card
year: 2

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "Wait times at our facilities are so long we're getting unfavorable comparisons to ER. The show. You remember. Look, we need to do something about these wait times."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "Patient traffic is not being managed well, and no two places handle it the same way."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_institute_guidelines_streamline_traffic, unlockable_incentivise_best_practices_beds, unlockable_hire_temp_administrators]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_institute_guidelines_streamline_traffic, unlockable_incentivise_best_practices_beds, unlockable_hire_temp_administrators]


# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_institute_guidelines_streamline_traffic: "We're probably going to have to paint lines on the floor to make this work, but it will be worth it in the long run."
  unlockable_incentivise_best_practices_beds: "Every time I heard someone yell 'we don't have any empty beds' I thought about that one ER where... You really don't remember? It won Emmys."
  unlockable_hire_temp_administrators: "I'm not sure the answer to clogged hospitals is more people, but it might work out."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
