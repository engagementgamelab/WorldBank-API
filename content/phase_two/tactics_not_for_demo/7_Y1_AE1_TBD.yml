# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_TBD
tactic_name: unlockable_make_aesthetic_improvements # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "TBD" # <--- display name for card
year: 3

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "Providers are complaining that the aesthetic improvements were a waste of time and money, and are asking that we not require them to complete the rennovations."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "It seems that most customers were pretty happy with the facilities as they were before. I don't think they will have too much of an impact. I'm not sure how this will effect staff morale, though."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "I believe letting hospital management concentrate on services instead of rennovations would improve things a good deal in terms of staff morale."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_grant_permission]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_grant_permission]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_grant_permission]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_grant_permission]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_continue_with_plan_aesthetic: "I'll tell them to follow the plan as it was designed."
  unlockable_grant_permission: "I'll let them know that they can cease rennovations and concentrate on services."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
