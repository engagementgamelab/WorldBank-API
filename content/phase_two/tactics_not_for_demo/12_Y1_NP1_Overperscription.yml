# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_overperscription
tactic_name: unlockable_incentivise_providers_to_follow_protocols # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Overperscription" # <--- display name for card
year: 1

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The community verifier tells me doctors are prescribing unnecessary medicines, which puts a strain on patients."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "Patients aren't happy unless they leave the hospital with a prescrption, so doctors prescribe them something innocuous."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_limit_perscriptions, unlockable_incentivise_following_set_protocols, unlockable_retrain_doctors]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_limit_perscriptions, unlockable_incentivise_following_set_protocols, unlockable_retrain_doctors]


# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_limit_perscriptions: "If they need fewer, they'll have an empty pad burning a whole in their pocket. If they need more, it'll be a nightmare."
  unlockable_incentivise_following_set_protocols: "We're counting on the promise of incentives outweighing the headache of a cranky patient, but it doesn't help people to give them a bunch of medicine they don't need."
  unlockable_retrain_doctors: "This is mostly a bedside manner problem, and reminding doctors they're allowed to say "no" is a lot cheaper than paying them to."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
