# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_infection_rates
tactic_name: unlockable_incentivise_providers_to_follow_protocols # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Infection Rates" # <--- display name for card
year: 2

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "There's been a sharp uptick in infections recently and it's probably on us."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "Surprise! Sanitization protocols are not being followed and that's why people are getting these awful infections."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_incentivise_sanitization_protocols, unlockable_incentivise_best_practices, unlockable_sanction_providers_with_high_infection_rates]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_incentivise_sanitization_protocols, unlockable_incentivise_best_practices, unlockable_sanction_providers_with_high_infection_rates]


# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_incentivise_sanitization_protocols: "It smacks of gold star rewards for kids. 'Wash your hands, children!' Oh well. As long as it doesn't drain the descretionary budget too much."
  unlockable_incentivise_best_practices: "If we're going to give them money, we might as well ask them to try a little harder than 'good enough not to maybe kill somebody.'"
  unlockable_sanction_providers_with_high_infection_rates: "If staff can't be bothered to follow sanitation guidelines, then we are well within our rights to sanction them."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
