# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_poor_surveys
tactic_name: unlockable_improve_patient_and_provider_relationship_not_selected  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Poor Surveys" # <--- display name for card
year: 2

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "Surveys are showing that trust in healthcare facilities is not rising."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The problem may be caused by bad personal interactions with individual health workers."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_directly_incensitive_service_better, unlockable_sensitization_campaign]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_directly_incensitive_service_better, unlockable_sensitization_campaign]


# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_directly_incensitive_service_better: "Patients can be really demanding, but if you get paid for making them happy, that should prioritize that for them."
  unlockable_sensitization_campaign: "I'm thinking, for effectiveness' sake, we should not just tell doctors not to be jerks. But sometimes they could stand to hear just that."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
