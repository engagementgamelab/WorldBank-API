# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_wrong_procedures_2
tactic_name: unlockable_incentivise_providers_to_follow_protocols # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Wrong Procedures 2" # <--- display name for card
year: 3

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "Our community verifier has informed us of more patients who have received wrong procedures."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "Referrals have increased, but in an almost random way."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_incentivise_best_practices_high_goals, unlockable_sanction_providers_performing_unnecessary_procedures]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_incentivise_best_practices_high_goals, unlockable_sanction_providers_performing_unnecessary_procedures]


# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_incentivise_best_practices_high_goals: "Just make sure they have high goals, and meet them, before rewarding hospitals for not taking peoples' appendices."
  unlockable_sanction_providers_performing_unnecessary_procedures: "This is a serious problem. Unnecessary surgery isn't something we can wait and see with, so I'm glad you set this precedent."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
