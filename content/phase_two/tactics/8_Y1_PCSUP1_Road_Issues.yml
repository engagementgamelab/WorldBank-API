# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_road_issues
tactic_name: unlockable_contract_private_company_to_deliver_supplies  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Road Issues" # <--- display name for card
year: 1

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "According to reports, there have been a number of late deliveries. I haven't gotten word on what is causing this to happen, but we should rectify the situation."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The late deliveries seem to be due to heavy rains suffered this year washing out roads, according to the company. We could penalize them, or advise them to find better routes--they can even use the train if it works better--all we want is results."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "Even as unreliable as the train is, it may be better than depending on roads. We could end the contract and go back to using the trains, or continue to try our luck with the shipping company."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_penalize_delivery_co]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_penalize_delivery_co]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_switch_to_train_service]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_switch_to_train_service]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_penalize_delivery_co: "I'll inform their representative of the penalty. If they can't meet our demands, we'll need to go further next time."
  unlockable_switch_to_train_service: "I know we had trouble with the trains before, but they aren't as vulnerable as roads."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
