# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_nationalist_backlash
tactic_name: unlockable_information_campaign_to_change_cultural_behaviors  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "No Effect" # <--- display name for card
year: 3

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "This IEC campaign does not seem to add value. We have tried different things, but the indicators don't seem to be improving. There are some religious and political pressures to halt this campaign as well."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "Some people say the campaign should be ended; they want more children to vote and feel the promotion of family planning goes against this. Maybe the campaign messages need to be revised accordingly for cultural sensitivity, with a focus on family spacing rather than a focus on averting pregnancies. Others want it halted altogether. It's a minority that is opposed to this, but very vocal with the elections coming up."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "This seems tied to the election. The conservative candidate for governor is claiming he wants more votes, so more children! We could speak to him directly, perhaps?"


# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_revise_language_in_campaign_t2, unlockable_halt_campaign_t2]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_revise_language_in_campaign_t2, unlockable_halt_campaign_t2]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_request_meeting_with_candidate_t2]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_request_meeting_with_candidate_t2]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_revise_language_in_campaign_t2: "We could write some copy about how our language is inflammatory, but if you have actual inflammation, real medicine helps! No? Okay, I'll tone down the language."
  unlockable_halt_campaign_t2: "It's not going to raise awareness to stop advertising. Some nationalist politician is jeopardizing public health to gain traction."
  unlockable_request_meeting_with_candidate_t2: "I admire you wanting to sit down with this politico. I think it'll frustrate you to no end, but I respect you for it."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "If we don't engage it'll probably just fizzle out."
