# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "Our community verifier has informed us of more patients who have been prescribed more than five fancy medicines for something like a simple flu. They are then told to go to the private pharmacy to buy the drugs."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The private pharmacy is run by the doctor's nephew."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_incentivise_best_practices_high_goals, unlockable_sanction_providers_performing_unnecessary_procedures]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_incentivise_best_practices_high_goals, unlockable_sanction_providers_performing_unnecessary_procedures]


# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_incentivise_best_practices_high_goals: "Just make sure include patient treatment charts against protocols. We do not want to pay for services below standard."
  unlockable_sanction_providers_performing_unnecessary_procedures: "This is a serious problem. I hope this will solve it."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
