# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_what_is_covered
tactic_name: unlockable_conditional_cash_transfer  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "What Is Covered" # <--- display name for card
year: 1 

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The community organization has reported that some individuals are going to facilities and returning without being treated, and others say they have been told not to 'waste their time' at clinics and hospitals."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "We conducted interviews on this, and it seems that people are showing up at the hospital expecting cash transfers for things not covered. They get so upset they leave without any services and are telling people to stay away."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_broaden_what_is_covered, unlockable_information_campaign_to_explain_what_is_covered]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_broaden_what_is_covered, unlockable_information_campaign_to_explain_what_is_covered]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_broaden_what_is_covered: "I'll add this to the itinerary when contracts come up for review. This could get more people into facilities to receive the services we are emphasizing."
  unlockable_information_campaign_to_explain_what_is_covered: "I'll inform providers they need to act on this. Once people understand how this program works, this problem should go away."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
