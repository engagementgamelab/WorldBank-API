# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "TBD"

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "It's possible that people don't want the services for some reason. A more targeted information campaign could be of use. It also seems that people are having difficulty getting to hospitals. Here are our recommendations:"

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "It's possible that people don't want the services for some reason. A more targeted information campaign could be of use. It also seems that people are having difficulty getting to hospitals. Here are our recommendations:"

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_sanction_offending_workiers, unlockable_warning_t4]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_sanction_offending_workiers, unlockable_warning_t4]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_sanction_those_providers]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_sanction_those_providers]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_sanction_offending_workiers: "TBD"
  unlockable_warning_t4: "My concern is that if we only warn them, they aren't going to stop. On the other hand, this kind of thing is hard to prove, so that isn't very helpful, either."
  unlockable_sanction_those_providers: "The usual indignance. We don't have any hard evidence, but I wouldn't be surprised if this is the last we hear about falsified reports."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
