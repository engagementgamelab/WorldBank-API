# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_underutilization
tactic_name: unlockable_conditional_cash_transfer  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Underutilization" # <--- display name for card
year: 2 

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "For some reason, people just aren't taking advantage of this program as much as they should be. Our projections were flawed somehow."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "After conducting surveys, it's clear that the incentives we identified just aren't worth it to most people."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "There may be some social or cultural barrier at play here that is discouraging people from accepting these incentives. Changing the incentives all together, and repackaging the program seems advisable."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_increase_incentives_t2]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_increase_incentives_t2]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_use_a_different_incentive]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_use_a_different_incentive]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_increase_incentives_t2: "We just need to find the right level to be attractive."
  unlockable_use_a_different_incentive: "Let's go back to the ethnography and try to figure out the right kind of incentive and how to present this program in a way that will be attractive to the most people."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
