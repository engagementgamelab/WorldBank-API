# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_poor_voucher_usage
tactic_name: unlockable_vouchers_for_services # <--- plan option symbol stored in unlockables.yml this comes from
name: "Poor Voucher Usage" # <--- display name for card
year: 1

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The manager of the voucher agency is concerned. We don't know why at this point, but we're not hitting our targets for voucher use. Do you want me to investigate this? Or shall we just observe for now?"

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "It's possible that people don't know about the services for some reason. A more targeted information campaign could be of use. It also seems that people are having difficulty getting to hospitals. Here are our recommendations:"

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_information_campaign_69, unlockable_add_travel_vouchers, unlockable_increase_budget_for_outreach]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_information_campaign_69, unlockable_add_travel_vouchers, unlockable_increase_budget_for_outreach]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_add_travel_vouchers: "That's a worthwhile idea, and it should help people reach health facilities."
  unlockable_information_campaign_69: "I'll contact the providers and let them know they must do more to explain their services."
  unlockable_increase_budget_for_outreach: "I will make the arrangements. As long as there are enough nurses available to carry out these outreach activities, this should help."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
