# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The targeted communities are not responding as well as they could to the CCT program. People are using the services, but the numbers in the poorest towns are not improving."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "It could be the incentives are not sufficient. Alternatively, there could be a social or cultural barrier that we did not foresee. I could investigate this."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "Some women have said they are uncomfortable giving birth anywhere but their own house. We could begin a campaign to counter this belief, or even pay traditional birth attendants for bringing women into facilities to give birth."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_increase_incentives]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_increase_incentives]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_cultural_campaign, unlockable_incentivise_traditional_midwives]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_cultural_campaign, unlockable_incentivise_traditional_midwives]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_increase_incentives: "By raising the incentives, we can bring more women into these clinics."
  unlockable_cultural_campaign: "It will be a challenge to convince women to change their ways. I hope we are up to it!"
  unlockable_incentivise_traditional_midwives: "This is an interesting approach!"
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
