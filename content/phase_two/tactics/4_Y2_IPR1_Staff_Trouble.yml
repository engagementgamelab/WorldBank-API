# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_staff_trouble
tactic_name: unlockable_improve_patient_and_provider_relationship  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Staff Trouble" # <--- display name for card
year: 2

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "I am getting reports from on of our health providers that their staff, doctors, and nurses are rebelling. They are tired of filling out customer service forms, and aren't receiving incentives. They are threatening to leave."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "Something clearly isn't working here. Increasing incentives and expiditing payments could help, but other facilities are handling this much better. Maybe retraining, or even a culling and rehiring might be worth looking into."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_retrain_t2, unlockable_cull_and_rehire, unlockable_increase_incentives_and_expidite_payment]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_retrain_t2, unlockable_cull_and_rehire, unlockable_increase_incentives_and_expidite_payment]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_retrain_t2: "TBD"
  unlockable_cull_and_rehire: "The people we're cutting were pretty entrenched in things before we came in. It's not fun to fire that many people, and we'll probably rehire a lot of them, but the distance will help."
  information_campaign: "I told them we're increasing incentives and getting them out faster and they said 'getting them to us at all would be faster'. So, we really have to make sure that happens."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
