# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_poor_campaign_coverage
tactic_name: unlockable_information_campaign_to_change_cultural_behaviors  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Poor Effect of Campaign" # <--- display name for card
year: 1

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "Incentivizing community health workers to do IEC for BCC does not seem to have the desired effect: there is no increase in women delivering in the facility."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "My investigation showed that it is not the fact that they don't know about delivery in a facility, but cultural issues. The women culturally are supposed to deliver at home and stay in the house for the first week. This is why we have very low numbers on institutional delivery and post-natal care indicators. The tradition is to deliver in the house with a Traditional Birth Assistant (TBA), often pressured by the mother-in-law. These unskilled deliveries lead to a lot of maternal deaths in the home."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_incentivize_bring_women_to_facilities_2, unlockable_incentivize_midwives_home_delivery_2, unlockable_leave_things_as_is_2]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_incentivize_bring_women_to_facilities_2, unlockable_incentivize_midwives_home_delivery_2, unlockable_leave_things_as_is_2]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_incentivize_bring_women_to_facilities_2: "This sounds like a smart strategy."
  unlockable_incentivize_midwives_home_delivery_2: "This may work. It will require more staff at the health facility, though if midwives travel to a house, you will need another to cover the clinic. We will also need to be mindful of quality and ensure they have all the equipment and the conditions to deliver in the home."
  unlockable_leave_things_as_is_2: "We might not need to spend all the money for this staff, but if not, we should probably cut the program at year's end."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "If we don't engage it'll probably just fizzle out."
