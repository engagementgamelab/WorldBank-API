# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_confusion_of_roles
tactic_name: unlockable_outreach  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Confusion of Roles" # <--- display name for card
year: 1

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "We haven't seen the outreach teams yet. They are supposed to be delivering services in the field already."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "My investigation showed that providers are not conducting the outreach as required by the contract. However, the ministry is requiring the providers to submit plans for outreach, and so far the ministry hasn't approved these plans."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_clarify_role_for_ministry, unlockable_tell_providers_to_act_without_ministry_approval]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_clarify_role_for_ministry, unlockable_tell_providers_to_act_without_ministry_approval]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_clarify_role_for_ministry: "It could help to explain the separation of functions and autonomy, and to redefine the roles and responsibilities for each stakeholder."
  unlockable_tell_providers_to_act_without_ministry_approval: "I will tell providers to carry out implementation activities without Ministry authorization."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
