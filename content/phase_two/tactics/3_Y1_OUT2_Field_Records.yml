# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_field_records
tactic_name: unlockable_outreach  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Field Records" # <--- display name for card
year: 1

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The nurses working in communities have had some issues with recordkeeping in the fields. The forms often have mistakes or never show up, then the providers try to claim them anyway."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The providers claim the problem is the nurses themselves. I could try to contact some of them directly to see what's going on. Or we could issue a warning to the providers that employ them."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "Nurses say they are over-taxed in communities. Actually hiring more might give them the leeway they need to pay more attention to record keeping."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_warning_t3]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_warning_t3]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_advise_providers_to_hire_more_outreach_staff]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_advise_providers_to_hire_more_outreach_staff]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_warning_t3: "I will tell the providers that they must be responsible for their employees."
  unlockable_advise_providers_to_hire_more_outreach_staff: "Let's make it a priority during the contract negotiation and the Business Plan elaboration."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
