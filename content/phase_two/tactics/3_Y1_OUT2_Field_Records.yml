# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_field_records
tactic_name: unlockable_outreach  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Field Records" # <--- display name for card
year: 1

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The health workers working in communities have had some issues with recordkeeping in the fields. The forms often have mistakes or don't show up to the health facility in time."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The verifiers have found that the health facilities are reporting inaccurate data on the actual services provided. We could issue the health facilities a warning."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "In fact, it looks like the outreach workers are unable to make it to the health facility regularly enough. This leads to under-reporting and thus health facilities and outreach workers do not receive all the incentives they are eligible for each month. Maybe there is not enough awareness of what they lose out on. We can retrain them, or start by verifying and paying them on a quarterly basis instead of monthly."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_warning_t3]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_warning_t3]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_retrain_outreach_nurses, unlockable_move_to_quarterly_basis]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_retrain_outreach_nurses, unlockable_move_to_quarterly_basis]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_warning_t3: "I will tell the providers that they must be responsible for their employees."
  unlockable_retrain_outreach_nurses: "Let's make it a priority so we get this right from the start"
  unlockable_move_to_quarterly_basis: "Alright, with any luck adjusting the pay-cycle might get the results we want."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
