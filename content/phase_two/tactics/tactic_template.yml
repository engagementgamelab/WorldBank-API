# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_card_1
tactic_name: unlockable_more_autonomy  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Tactic card name" # <--- display name for card

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The manager of the voucher agency is concerned. We don’t know why at this point, but we’re not hitting our targets for voucher use. Do you want me to investigate this? Or shall we just observe for now?"

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "It's possible that people don't want the services for some reason. A more targeted information campaign could be of use. It also seems that people are having difficulty getting to hospitals. Here are our recommendations:"

# This is a special parameter that loads a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') must correspond to the one under "feedback"
new_options:
  information_campaign: "Information Campaign"
  transportation_vouchers: "Add travel vouchers"
  increase_budget: "Increase budget for travelling nurses"

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  transportation_vouchers: "That's simple enough to do. Hopefully that solves it."
  information_campaign: "I'll contact the providers and let them know they must do more to explain their services."
  increase_budget: "I will make the arrangements. Hopefully there are enough nurses available to fill the new positions..."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
