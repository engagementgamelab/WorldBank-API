# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_overexposure
tactic_name: unlockable_information_campaign_to_counter_misinformation  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Overexposure" # <--- display name for card
year: 2

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The response to our campaign seems to be dropping off significantly. Should I look into the cause of this?"

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "It appears that our information campaign has now gone too well, and we have become over-exposed."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_temporarily_reduce_output, unlockable_end_campaign]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_temporarily_reduce_output, unlockable_end_campaign]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_temporarily_reduce_output: "We've had plenty of exposure so far. This should give people time to refresh."
  unlockable_end_campaign: "We can talk again at the end of the year and decide if this is worth the expenditure."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
