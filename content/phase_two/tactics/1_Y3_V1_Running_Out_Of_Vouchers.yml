# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The manager of the voucher agency is concerned. We don’t know why at this point, but we’re not hitting our targets for voucher use. Do you want me to investigate this? Or shall we just observe for now?"

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "It's possible that people don't want the services for some reason. A more targeted information campaign could be of use. It also seems that people are having difficulty getting to hospitals. Here are our recommendations:"

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  transportation_vouchers: "That's simple enough to do. Hopefully that solves it."
  information_campaign: "I'll contact the providers and let them know they must do more to explain their services."
  increase_budget: "I will make the arrangements. Hopefully there are enough nurses available to fill the new positions..."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
