# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_printing_issues
tactic_name: unlockable_information_campaign_to_counter_misinformation # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Backlash" # <--- display name for card
year: 3

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "We are running out of pamphlets at most facilities."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The printer we hired to create them is unreliable and keeps missing print deadlines, sometimes by many weeks. I could look for new printers, or we could let facilities produce their own materials. We'd need to provide equipment and materials, though."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "It'll cost more, but I guess this is what we get for going with the cheapest option. We'll have to find room for that in the budget."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_provide_health_facilities_with_equipment_to_print_materials]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_provide_health_facilities_with_equipment_to_print_materials]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_increase_budget_for_printing_informational_collateral]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_increase_budget_for_printing_informational_collateral]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_increase_budget_for_printing_informational_collateral: "This ended up being more of a cost than we realized, since now we have employees printing these up, which cuts into their time. And if they all need ink at the same time, we're doomed."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
