# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_payment_inconsistency
tactic_name: unlockable_conditional_cash_transfer  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Payment Inconsistency" # <--- display name for card
year: 3 

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "We have been going over the budget, and it looks like we have been overpaying. Our output does not match the indicators."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The finance ministry has been OKing payments to providers even though goals have not been met. Apparently providers have been focusing on improving quality, which has taken longer than expected, so the finance ministry made an exception."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_only_pay_for_results, unlockable_allow_temporary_exception]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_only_pay_for_results, unlockable_allow_temporary_exception]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_only_pay_for_results: "Clearly we can't authorize payments without verified results on pre-agreed behavior change."
  unlockable_allow_temporary_exception: "So we'll allow that payment in the hopes it will encourage service utilisation even for other indicators. It is a social program, anyway."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
