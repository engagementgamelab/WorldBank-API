# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_payment_inconsistency
tactic_name: unlockable_conditional_cash_transfer  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Payment Inconsistency" # <--- display name for card
year: 3 

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "I have been hearing complaints from clients that the CCT payments are not being paid on time. They are losing faith in the program."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "It seems the Ministry of Finance has been delaying payment on these due to poor communication within their department. We should either push them to speed up, or consider cutting back the CCT program, if we don't have the capacity to process it."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_push_minfin_to_expedite_payments, unlockable_cut_back_cct]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_push_minfin_to_expedite_payments, unlockable_cut_back_cct]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_push_minfin_to_expedite_payments: "I'll draft a memo to the Minister's office right away stressing the importance of timely payments."
  unlockable_cut_back_cct: "I'll try to work with the Ministry to determine their capacity and reasses the scale of the program for the coming year."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
