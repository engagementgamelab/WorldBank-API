# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_false_declarations
tactic_name: unlockable_vouchers_for_services # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "False Declarations" # <--- display name for card
year: 2

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The Voucher Agency Manager just called to tell me they found false declarations in the reports from the providers. These look to be invented cases."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The hospital adminstrators deny they have made fraudulent claims, but the numbers they submit are impossible. It could be lower-level employees making false claims."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "The providers seem to be encouraging their workers to bring in vouchers by offering bonuses."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_warning_t2, unlockable_sanctions_t2]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_warning_t2, unlockable_sanctions_t2]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_employee_capacity_building]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_employee_capacity_building]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_warning_t2: "The senior staff management should be personally verifying reports before the third party verifier sees it. This is fraud, and not acceptable."
  unlockable_sanctions_t2: "This warrants a strong response. If it continues, we might need to go further and look for other providers in the area."
  unlockable_employee_capacity_building: "We'll focus on training and emphasizing the proper way to do reporting."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
