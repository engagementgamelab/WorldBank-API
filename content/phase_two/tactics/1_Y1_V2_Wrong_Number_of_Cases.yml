# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_wrong_number_of_cases
tactic_name: unlockable_wrong_number_of_cases  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Wrong Number of Cases" # <--- display name for card
year: 1

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The Verifier just let me know that the number of cases reported for the voucher program appears to be incorrect."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "I verified this with the providers, and they claim that this was an unintended mistake. We could just issue a nonpayment, or we could issue sanctions. Alternatively, I could investigate further for evidence of fraud."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "My investigation did not turn up any hard evidence of fraud."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options:
  Warning: "Warning"
  Sanctions: "Sanctions"

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects:
  Warning: affect_wrong_number_of_cases_warning
  Sanctions: affect_wrong_number_of_cases_sanctions

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options:
  something_1: "Warning"
  something_2: "Sanctions"

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects:
  Warning: example_1
  Sanctions: example_2

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  Warning: "Warning: I'll issue the warning and let the fundholder know that payments should be withheld for the false cases."
  Sanctions: "Sanctions: We'll levy sanctions, then. My analysis suggests they can afford to pay the penalty."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
