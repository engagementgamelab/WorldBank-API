tactic_name: unlockable_improve_patient_and_provider_relationship  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Possible Fraud" # <--- display name for card
year: 3

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "It seems that some health workers are falsifying claims on their customer service reports."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "TBD"

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "Some facilities seem to be pressuring employees into getting better ratings."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_sanction_offending_workers, unlockable_warning_t4]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_sanction_offending_workers, unlockable_warning_t4]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_sanction_those_providers]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_sanction_those_providers]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_sanction_offending_workers: "TBD"
  unlockable_warning_t4: "My concern is that if we only warn them, they aren't going to stop. On the other hand, this kind of thing is hard to prove, so that isn't very helpful, either."
  unlockable_sanction_those_providers: "The usual indignance. We don't have any hard evidence, but I wouldn't be surprised if this is the last we hear about falsified reports."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
