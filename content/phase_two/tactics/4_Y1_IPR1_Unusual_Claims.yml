# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_unusual_claims
tactic_name: unlockable_improve_patient_and_provider_relationship  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Unusual Claims" # <--- display name for card
year: 1

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The third-party verifier has found some errors in the community verifier's reporting on patient satisfaction. We should look into this."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The problem could be a simple one: satisfaction is difficult to objectively measure. Revising our surveys might be in order. Alternatively, the problem could be the community verifiers themselves. They may just need more training to carry out interviews in a way that avoids bias."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "I looked into the community verifiers' methodology more closely, including who was actually hired. It seems that many of their employees have close ties to the health facilities. This makes them biased, unfortunately. We may need to address this directly by reorganizing their staff."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_train_community_verifiers, unlockable_revise_cv_surveys]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_train_community_verifiers, unlockable_revise_cv_surveys]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_reorganize_cv_staff]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_reorganize_cv_staff]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_train_community_verifiers: "These mistakes are fairly common, but with good training we can avoid them."
  unlockable_revise_cv_surveys: "We'll take a closer look at what's being asked and root out any biases we find."
  unlockable_reorganize_cv_staff: "I think this is the only way to counter an inherent bias in reporting."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
