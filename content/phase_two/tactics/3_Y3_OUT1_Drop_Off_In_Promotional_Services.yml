# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_drop_off_in_promotional_services
tactic_name: unlockable_outreach  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Drop-off in Promotional Services" # <--- display name for card
year: 3

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "The Community Verifier tells me that there has been a large drop-off in simple health activities such as promoting hand-washing and sanitation at the household level. These aren't incentivized services, but they are very important."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "The outreach staff has been spending time searching out the last children in each community who have not been vaccinated, and hanging around pregnant women's homes so they can refer them for the incentive bonus. They do this instead of the promotional services, since that's where the incentives push them."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_warn_outreach_staff, unlockable_incentivize_promotional_services, unlockable_change_nothing]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_warn_outreach_staff, unlockable_incentivize_promotional_services, unlockable_change_nothing]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_incentivize_promotional_services: "This should ensure that these fundamental services take place."
  unlockable_warn_outreach_staff: "We'll tell them that this behavior is not acceptable, and that further steps may be taken if need be."
  unlockable_change_nothing: "Perhaps this will work itself out in time."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
