# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_backlash
tactic_name: unlockable_information_campaign_to_counter_misinformation  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Backlash" # <--- display name for card
year: 3

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "There has been some backlash about this campaign from users of traditional medicine. They consider it insulting and inflammatory."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "Some people want the campaign to be revised for cultural sensitivity, while others want it halted all together. It's a minority that is opposed to this, but very vocal. I wonder what has them so upset after more than two years?"

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "It turns out there is an election for regional governor coming up, and the conservative candidate is stirring the pot against those promoting non-traditional ways, including us! We could speak with him directly, perhaps."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_revise_language_in_campaign, unlockable_halt_campaign]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_revise_language_in_campaign, unlockable_halt_campaign]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_request_meeting_with_candidate]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_request_meeting_with_candidate]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_revise_language_in_campaign: "We could write some copy about how our language is inflammatory, but if you have actual inflammation, real medicine helps! No? OK. I'll tone down the language."
  unlockable_halt_campaign: "It's not going to raise awareness to stop advertising. Some nationalist politician is jeopardizing public health to gain traction."
  unlockable_request_meeting_with_candidate: "I admire you wanting to sit down with this politico. I think it'll frustrate you to no end, but I respect you for it."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "If we don't engage it'll probably just fizzle out."
