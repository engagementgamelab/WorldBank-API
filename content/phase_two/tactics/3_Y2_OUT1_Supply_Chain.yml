# Phase Two Tactic YML Template

symbol: tactic_supply_chain
tactic_name: unlockable_outreach  # <--- symbol of the tactic (stored in unlockables.yml) this card is using
name: "Supply Chain" # <--- display name for card
year: 2

# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "My team has been conducting some interviews for monitoring purposes, and the outreach staff claim they don't have adequate supplies to perform in the field."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "This speaks to quality of care. The spokesperson at the Ministry of Health says that there are problems with the supply chain from the central level. The Ministry says we need to incentivise following protocols more strongly. Then facilities will be able to pay for better supplies."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "My analysis shows that if anything, more nurses would be of a benefit, but given the supply issues, hiring more right now wouldn't be prudent."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_introduce_quality_of_care_incentives_at_community_level, unlockable_strengthen_supply_chain]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_introduce_quality_of_care_incentives_at_community_level, unlockable_strengthen_supply_chain]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_introduce_quality_of_care_incentives_at_community_level: "This is the only solution that I can reconcile with the data."
  unlockable_strengthen_supply_chain: "This will take some care to achieve, but with the limitations on our staff, it may be the best option."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
