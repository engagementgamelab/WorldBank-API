# This dialogue the player sees first
initiating_dialogue: "Providers have been requested to establish a beautiful garden at the facility in order to attract patients and attain the bonus. They are complaining that the focus on the garden is a waste of time and money, and are asking that we not require them to complete this."

# The dialogue the player sees when investigation has results to show
investigate_dialogue: "It seems that most customers do not really care about the garden. I don't think it will have too much of an impact. The staff seems to like it, though."

# The dialogue the player sees when further investigation has results to show
investigate_further_dialogue: "I believe letting the facility management concentrate on delivering services instead of establishing a garden would improve things a good deal in terms of patient satisfaction."

# These are special parameters that load a cooldown array, which is defined in content/config.yml under 'cooldown:'
# For example, specifying $config_cooldown_long will choose the key found in config.yml under:
# ----- cooldown:
# -----  long: [20, 14, 10]
investigate_cooldown: $config_cooldown_short
investigate_further_cooldown: $config_cooldown_long

# These are the usable player options added after investigation is done
# Note that each key (e.g. 'information_campaign') MUST correspond to the one under "_affects" and feedback"
new_options: [unlockable_grant_permission]

# The affects for each new option
new_options_affects: [unlockable_grant_permission]

# These are the usable player options added after further investigation is done
further_options: [unlockable_grant_permission]

# The affects for each further new option
further_options_affects: [unlockable_grant_permission]

# This is the feedback dialogue the player sees based on the option they select
feedback_dialogue:
  unlockable_continue_with_plan_aesthetic: "I'll tell them to follow the program as it was designed."
  unlockable_grant_permission: "I'll let them know that they can cease with the gardening and concentrate on delivering services to patients."
  # This key is required for every tactic card for when the player chooses observe instead of investigate
  observe: "OK, we'll wait and see if anything changes."
