  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "The other day, a woman was getting her prenatal checkup. She's in the stirrups and the doctor had to leave the examin room to get lectured on what all care she was supposed to give. That has got to stop."
        
 hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "I couldn't do what the NGO Director does. No argument there. But they are not so good at their job that they can do mine, too."
