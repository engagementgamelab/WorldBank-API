    dialogue: "I am so tired of all this finger pointing. You have to be too, I know."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "The way I see it, and this is just my opinion, is that the people at the NGO and the Director of Regional Health Services are the ones who need to figure this out. I just want to run my hospitals."
