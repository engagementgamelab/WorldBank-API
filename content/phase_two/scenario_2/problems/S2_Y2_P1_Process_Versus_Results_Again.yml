  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "No, they didn't meet their goals, but that doesn't mean my providers and their patients should suffer for it. We're between a rock and hard place."

      warn_but_allow_payment_once_2: "It's good to know we can count on you, just like you're counting on us."
      deny_payment_2: "We're struggling with these numbers as it is. It hurts patients when we don't have money to work with." 

  coach:
    dialogue: "I don't think the NGO is managing as well as they could, but maybe we need to adjust our expectations."

    feedback:
      revise_indicators: "OK, at year's end I'll sit the fundholder down with the NGO and we'll figure out some realistic goals. In the meantime, we'll hold payment."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "It's the same as last time, and until someone says they're making numbers when they're actually making them up, I'm not much help."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "The other day I followed up with a woman who vaccinated her son against dengue right before the mosquitos got bad. The numbers aren't great, but if the payments stop, that'll be worse."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "If I'm not getting money to run my hospitals, I don't know how I can be expected to treat people. I'd love to get more people in, but I'm glad for what we are doing."
