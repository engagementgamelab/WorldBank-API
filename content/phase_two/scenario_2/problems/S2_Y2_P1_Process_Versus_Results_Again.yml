    dialogue: "No, they didn't meet their targets, but that doesn't mean my providers and patients should suffer for it. We're between a rock and hard place."

  ngo_manager:
    feedback:
      warn_but_allow_payment_once_2: "It's good to know we can count on you in an emergency, just like you can count on us."
      deny_payment_2: "We're struggling with achieving these targets as it is. It hurts patients when we don't have enough money to work with." 

  coach:
    dialogue: "I don't think the NGO is managing as well as they could. They really should have contingency funding, but maybe in the end they really do need more resources."

    feedback:
      revise_indicators: "OK, at year's end I'll sit the purchaser down together with the NGO and we'll figure out some realistic targets and prices."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "I can confirm that they are not meeting their targets, but other than that, I'm not much help."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "The other day I followed up with a woman who vaccinated her son against dengue right before the mosquitoes got bad. The numbers aren't great, but if the payments stop, it will make the situation worse."

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "If there is no money to do outreach, I don't know how we can reach and treat people. I'd love to get more people in, but I'm glad for what we are doing."
