    feedback:
      cease_counter_verification: "If you think they don't need more looking into, that's fine, I trust you."
      clarification_of_roles_1: "Next time, let's try to avoid this by making everyone's job clear beforehand. Thanks."

  director_regional_health_services: 
    dialogue: "I'm with the Minister on this, I want to know what the NGOs are doing."

  ngo_manager:
    dialogue: "We verify everything, I promise. We also give third-party access to the verification, there is no need for the government to also verify."

    feedback:
      pressure_the_ngo_to_comply_1: "It takes a lot of time for us to comply with all these verifications. I'm worried we won't have time to meet our targets if we're busy with paperwork."

  coach:
    dialogue: "The issue of verification doesn't have to do with anyone but the NGO and the Third Party Verifier. Negotiate with them."

    unlocks_affects: [clarification_of_roles_1]

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "It wouldn't be a lot more paperwork for us to submit for counter-verification, but I don't know that it's necessary. Is the third-party verifier not providing a copy to the government?"
