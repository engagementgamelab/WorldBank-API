    dialogue: "This is just another sign that our relationship with this NGO is not working. If it's not working, the contract should be terminated. We can work directly with providers."

    feedback:
      terminate_ngo_contract_3: "I get it that this has been stressful, so this might be for the best, but I hope you can handle this. For the patients' sakes."
      expedite_payment_and_service_delivery: "Thank you. This is going to work much better."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "Get the NGO their money! I have no empty beds! The doctors and nurses keep asking me when we're going to be able to do something about it and the best I can tell them is, well, I try to explain how all this is supposed to work. And that explanation doesn't do anything for a head wound."
