  dep_minister_of_health: 
    dialogue: "This is something I had to learn early on when I switched from practicing medicine to politics: if you can't cut something out of the budget, just stop budgeting for it. Just terminate the contract so we won't have to go through this."

  ngo_manager: 
    dialogue: "I know that to the Hospital Administrator, these stipulations seem really stringent, but you brought us on in part to reign in spending."

        terminate_ngo_contract_3: "I get it that this has been stressful, so this might be for the best, but I hope you can handle this. For the patients' sakes."
        expedite_payment_and_service_delivery: "Thank you. This is going to work much better."

  coach:
    dialogue: "It's probably too late to do it now, but before the year's out we should look into getting someone who can manage the contract so we don't have to go to bat every time there's an argument."

    feedback:
        clarification_of_roles_5: "Sure, you can remind the Ministry and NGO, again, who's supposed to do what. But that will only work until the next argument."
        hire_agency: "I know this is more money spent, but we need to focus on lowering the infant mortality rate, not refereeing a fight between adults."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "I'm sure you're getting good advice from the people who are writing the checks. They are, at least, smart enough to know what they want."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "You have an advisor, and that's good. Someone thinking about the big picture. Great. But maybe you should ask the people who are using this money to help people."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "Get the NGO their money! I have no empty beds! The doctors and nurses keep asking me when we're going to be able to do something about it and the best I can tell them is, well, I try to explain how all this is supposed to work. And that explanation doesn't do anything for a head wound."
