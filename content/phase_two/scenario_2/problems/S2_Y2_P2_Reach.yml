    feedback:
      increase_funding_for_ngo: "You realize you're rewarding these people for failure? I don't want to step in on this issue. Don't make me. "

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "The health care providers are working with the NGO according to the guidelines we laid out. We can go back to the manual and fix the problems in our policies."

    unlocks_affects: [revise_operating_manual]

  ngo_manager: 
    dialogue: "It's been a lot harder to reach some populations than we expected, especially down there. Those people are more entrenched in traditional medicine, and that's a big hump for us to get over when we can only afford the health care itself."
    unlocks: [increase_funding_for_ngo]
    feedback:
      contract_additional_ngo_at_years_end: "I think we could have done it, but it would be a lot of work to reach that province."
      terminate_ngo_contract_1: "We can't, cannot, get to absolutely everyone, so you're making it impossible to get health care for everyone else." 

  coach:
    dialogue: "Look, we have one group running things pretty well for most of the country. Maybe we need someone to run support for them who's more used to this kind of issue."

    unlocks_affects: [contract_additional_ngo_at_years_end]
    feedback:
        revise_operating_manual: "OK. I'll hunker down and get to work on the new manual, hammer some things out."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "I'm sure they are having trouble getting to some people, but no informational campaign is going to reach everybody."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "You can always just guide the NGO on how they should address this. It might be kind of micro-manage-y, but that's what you have a coach for, right?"
    narrows: [dep_minister_of_health, director_regional_health_services, third_party_verifier, community_verifier, hospital_administrator]

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "That is why you brought the NGO in, to get people treated. There might be someone who could do it better."
