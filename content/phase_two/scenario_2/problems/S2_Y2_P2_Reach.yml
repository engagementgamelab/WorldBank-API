  dep_minister_of_health:
    dialogue: "I'm not sure if having the NGO manage the delivery of services was a good idea in the long run. Maybe we should re-evaluate?"
    feedback:
      increase_funding_for_ngo: "You realize you're rewarding these people for failure? Please make sure that this is the right decision. "

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "The health care providers and the NGOs are working hard, but there are many social and cultural barriers to our progress in this region."

  ngo_manager: 
    dialogue: "It's been a lot harder to reach some populations than we expected, especially down there. The people in the South are more entrenched in traditional medicine, and that's a big obstacle for us to get over when we can only afford the health care itself."

    feedback:
      contract_additional_ngo_at_years_end: "I think we could have done it, but it would be a lot of work to reach that province in the south, so I think this is for the best."
      terminate_ngo_contract_1: "We cannot get to absolutely everyone, so you're making it impossible to get health care for everyone else." 

  coach:
    dialogue: "Look, we have one group running things pretty well for most of the country. Maybe we need another NGO who is more used to this kind of region, to focus our efforts on the population."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "I'm sure they are having trouble getting to some people, but it's impossible to reach everybody."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "You can always just guide the NGO on how they should address this. It might be kind of micro-manage-y, but that's what you have a coach for, right?"

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "That is why you brought this NGO in, to get people treated. There might be someone who could do it better."
