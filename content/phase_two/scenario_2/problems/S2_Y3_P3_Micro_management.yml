initiating_npc: dep_minister_of_health
initiating_dialogue: "We recently requested some very simple information from the NGO, and they refused to supply it. We have yet to see their training curriculum on information flow, and we're beginning to wonder why."

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "This curriculum is of particular interest to us since information flow and control are crucial, and we want to know how their employees are trained on this so we can approve it."
    unlocks: [warn_ngo_6]
    unlocks_affects: [warn_ngo_6]

  ngo_manager:
    dialogue: "Are we required by the contract to furnish this information? It's our property, after all, and we have a vested interest in keeping our processes private."
    feedback:
        warn_ngo_6: "I hear what you're saying, but I don't intend to change our practices unless it's mandated."
        clarification_of_roles_7: "I thought our roles were already clear. I still see no reason to furnish this information. Why should the government approve something so granular?"
        include_approval_ngo_curriculum_1: "If you really think it's necessary, we'll make this information public and allow the Ministry to approve it."

  coach:
    dialogue: "If the contract and the business plan do not state who has a right to this information, perhaps it should. At the start of the new year, let's revise this to make it clear."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "This seems like a dispute between the NGO and the ministry. Talk to them about it."
