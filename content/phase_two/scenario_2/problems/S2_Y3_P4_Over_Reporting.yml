  dep_minister_of_health: 
    dialogue: "We've struggled with the NGO in a number of ways, and this is the last straw as far as I'm concerned. Terminate the contract."
    unlocks: [terminate_ngo_contract_6]
    unlocks_affects: [terminate_ngo_contract_6]

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "I can imagine what the Dep. Minister told you, but I'm going to advise sanctioning them. They've been with us for a while now, after all."
    unlocks: [sanction_ngo_2]
    unlocks_affects: [sanction_ngo_2]

  ngo_manager:
    dialogue: "We made a lot of new hires this quarter to meet increased demand. This is a good thing! Our new staff members aren't reporting as they are supposed to, but we can rectify that. I'll pass your warning on."
    feedback:
      terminate_ngo_contract_6: "We've been getting kids vaccinated against fatal diseases, improving care, saving lives. That is what you are screwing up here."
      sanction_ngo_2: "I don't know what you expect me to do with more sanctions. I'm trying to manage a complex network!"
      warn_ngo_7: "I will pass this warning along. I promise it will be taken seriously."

  coach:
    dialogue: "This is very troubling. I would refer you to the Ministry for advice, as the responsibility of the project eventually rests with them."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "This is kind of a mess. I don't want this to turn into a bigger problem than it has to be."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "I have no knowledge of this. If the NGO is over-reporting results, it is happening at their level, not mine."
