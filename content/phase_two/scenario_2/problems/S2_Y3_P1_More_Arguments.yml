    feedback:
      warn_ngo_3: "OK, we'll try to stick with the national protocols, but our track record proves that ours are very successful."
      terminate_ngo_contract_4: "The whole reason you brought us on was nothing was getting accomplished. That's what we were doing."

    dialogue: "The contract says that the NGO should be using the national protocols, but it looks like they are using their own set of guidelines. You should talk to them, and the ministry, to work this out."

    feedback:
      hold_stakeholder_meeting_3: "For a problem like this, a truce is about as good as we can hope for. Well, maybe not a truce, as such. More of a cease fire."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "There's plenty of work to be done without these arguments."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "The other day, a woman was getting her prenatal checkup. She's waiting in the examination room for the doctor to arrive, but he was almost thirty minutes late because someone from the NGO was lecturing him on what kind of care to give. That has got to stop."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "I couldn't do what the NGO Director does. No argument there. But they are in my country, they should respect our health guidelines."
