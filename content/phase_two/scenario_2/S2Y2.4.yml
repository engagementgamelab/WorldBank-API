  dep_minister_of_health: 
    dialogue: "We've been whittling down whose job is whose throughout this process, so you don't have to tell me this isn't my place, but were it up to me, I'd cancel the NGO contract."

    unlocks_affects: [terminate_ngo_contract_3]
    
        
  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "The Ministry of Health has been handling these budgets for a long time. It wasn't perfect, but it worked better than this."

    feedback:
        clarify_roles: "OK. I'm just trying to make this work as smoothly and efficiently as possible."

  coach:
    dialogue: "I'll ask, because this seems to be an ongoing problem: is that the NGO's position? They seem to be overstepping their role."
    feedback:
        move_authority_to_ministry: "The Ministry already has a lot going on, but I guess they can handle local hospital budgeting, too."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "If they can't agree on a budget, I'm not going to have any cases to verify. And I like my job."
    
  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "If I were you, and I'm offering this as someone who lives here, ask the Ministry and your coach what to do. The Ministry gets the last call and the NGO doesn't."
