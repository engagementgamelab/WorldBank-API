      clarify_separation_of_functions_1: "all right, i understand. i'll inform the staff here." # <--- symbol of the option used and the feedback text for it

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "I know the Minister of Health fairly well, and I can tell you that things go more smoothly if you're cooperative."

  coach:
    dialogue: "Duplicating efforts seems to be hampering the health providers. I'd either clarify everyone's roles for them, or empower health providers to push back somehow."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "As long as these things get verified, that's all that matters to me."

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "Honestly, we've been ignoring the ministry's requests. We've got too much actual work to worry about."

  hospital_administrator:
    feedback:
      comply_with_ministry_1: "OK, we'll do our best."
      authorize_providers_to_take_action_at_their_level_1: "OK I'll bring it up the next time they send in their request, however, I will need some technical support to convince the ministry decision makers."
