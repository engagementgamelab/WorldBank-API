    dialogue: "I'm not sure working with these people was the best idea. Maybe we should seek another partner for next year."

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "We need to send a clear message that this is unacceptable. Strong sanctions are what I recommend."
    unlocks: [sanctions_4]
    unlocks_affects: [sanctions_4]

  coach:
    dialogue: "The guidelines are obviously not clear enough to either the new provider, the patients, or both. We need to issue updated guidelines that are clear."
    unlocks: [create_new_guidelines_1]
    unlocks_affects: [create_new_guidelines_1]
    feedback:
      create_new_guidelines_1: "Hopefully a little bit of clarity will get things back on track."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "Sorry, I'm kind of up to my elbows in work here, I don't know if I have much advice to contribute to this situation."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "It sounds like Provider 3 is taking advantage. This is not going to build trust in the new system."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "Maybe I should stop honoring these referrals, or scrutinize them more carefully at my level?"
    unlocks: [increase_scrutiny_1]
    unlocks_affects: [increase_scrutiny_1]
    feedback:
      increase_scrutiny_1: "I will need some assistance to put these protocols in place."

  health_provider_3:
    dialogue: "I am only doing what you asked, and referring people to the hospitals. What is the problem?"
    feedback:
      warning_9: "Many apologies! I think I now understand the problem."
      sanctions_4: "Why do I even refer people if you punish me afterwards? This is foolish."
