  coach:
    dialogue: "This has been going on for several years now. I'd recommend to sanction."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "The sample I surveyed does not align with the numbers you say they reported. Very suspicious."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "I don't think the clinic should get preferential treatment over my hospital. Treat them just as you would treat us."

  health_provider_4:
    dialogue: "I have some new staff, maybe they are confused about what to report? Frankly, I myself have been confused at times!"

      warning_10: "I'll talk to my staff and try to settle this."
      sanctions_6: "I just put in orders for new equipment. Now I won't be able to afford to pay for them. I think you are taking this too far. It was an honest mistake of newly employed staff."
      hold_meeting_to_retrain_on_reporting_practices_3: "I think that will probably help. Let me know when works for you and I'll clear some time for a meeting."
