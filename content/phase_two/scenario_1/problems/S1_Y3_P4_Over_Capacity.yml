    dialogue: "It's great news that they've managed to improve their performance so much."

  coach:
    dialogue: "I agree they are doing very well, and they may need more resources, but why don't you leave it to the provider to decide they want to hire more staff? In line with their autonomy, I mean."
    feedback: 
      expand_hiring_of_hospital_staff: "We gave the providers autonomy to decide how to best improve performance, are you sure this is the best solution? Shouldn't they decide?"

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "This is a good problem to have."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "The people in my most recent sample have been happy with the services they received, but did report long waits."

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "I'd love to have more staff too. Or is this just for the hospital? Wouldn't it be better if you gave us the money and let us decide how to get the best results?"
