  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "I have experienced similar problems with this provider. It is hard to schedule their time. Transparency to the community is a key priority to ensure in their next business plan."

    unlocks_affects: [revise_business_plan_to_include_transparency_1]

  coach:
    feedback: 
      continue_with_plan_2: "Quality is a very important area, this is a missed opportunity. They are losing out on many more resources linked to that indicator."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "Community transparency does not seem to be high on their agenda, so, yes, they are performing low on their quality score." 

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "This is a little outside of my purview."

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "I think you underestimate just how busy we have been with outreach and patient care. We are not a large staff, and our time is very precious. Maybe next quarter things will be slower and we can focus on this."
    feedback: 
      warning_1: "I'm sure I'll have some time next quarter once our busiest time dies down."
      revise_business_plan_to_include_transparency_1: "Hopefully things will be less busy so we can focus on that. If it can bring in more resources, then it's worth exploring."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "I've observed the clinics we're talking about a number of times, and there's never enough time and money to go around."
