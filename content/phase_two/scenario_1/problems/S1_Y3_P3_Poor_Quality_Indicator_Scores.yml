initiating_dialogue: "Hey, the third party verifier just came to assess our quality score, but I disagree with the assessment results. Given the amount of strain we are under, I believe we need to be granted some leeway in order to serve patients."

    dialogue: "Quality of care is important insofar as it enables better and more services to be delivered."

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "I recognize that their job is difficult, but quality of care is one of the indicators we are working to improve."

  coach:
    dialogue: "Quality of care is not something we should grant leeway on. It is crucially important, but if they are under such strain, they may require extra staff."

    Feedback: 
      review_the_inspection: "Thank you! I think you'll find our quality is sufficient."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "They scored poorly, plain and simple. A review is not necessary."
    unlocks: [deny_review]
    unlocks_affects: [deny_review]

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "These are small clinics, with very little operating budget. Denying payment will cause immediate harm to the community."

  clinic_manager:
    Feedback: 
      revise_business_plan_10: "I would appreciate some support from the coach to figure out how we can improve things here."
      deny_review: "If you aren't going to take me seriously, how can I have faith in this system?"

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "I can tell you it is painful to lose out in payment because of the quality score when things get busy. What harm is there in reviewing the inspection?"
