    dialogue: "Quality of care is important insofar as it enables better and more services to be deleivered."

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "I recognize that their job is difficult, but quality of care is one of the indicators we are working to improve."

  coach:
    dialogue: "Quality of care is not something we should grant leeway on. It is crucially important to the plan!"
    unlocks: [warning]

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "They failed inspection, plain and simple. A review is not necessary."
    unlocks: [deny_review]

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "These are small clinics, with very little operating budget. Denying payment will cause immediate harm to the community."

  clinic_manager:
    Feedback: 
      review_the_inspection: "Thank you! I think you'll find our quality is sufficient."
      warning_6: "I don't know what we can do to improve things before the year is out."
      deny_review: "This may be a serious problem. I was not paid last quarter, and it looks like I won't be paid this quarter."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "I can tell you it is painful to miss a payment, even when things are going well. What harm is there in reviewing the inspection?"
