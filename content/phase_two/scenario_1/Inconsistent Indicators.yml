  Director_Regional_Health_Services:
    dialogue: "I suggest hiring more outreach staff to operate in facilities near these settlements."
    Unlocks: [hire_more_outreach_staff]
    Unlocks_affects: [hire_more_outreach_staff]
    feedback:
      Hire_More_Outreach_Staff: "This makes a good deal of sense to me."

  Coach:
    dialogue: "We've tried many strategies to improve stagnant indicators. Perhaps the indicators need to be reviewed at the end of the year?"
    Unlocks: [review_indicators_at_end_of_year]
    Unlocks_affects: [review_indicators_at_end_of_year]
    feedback:
      Review_Indicators_at_End_of_Year: "It might make sense to revise goals down, or at the very least, perform another survey to make sure our population estimates were correct."

  Third_Party_Verifier:
    dialogue: "Are you concerned about fraud? I haven't seen direct evidence of it."

  Community_Verifier:
    dialogue: "People here are still reluctant to travel to facillities."

  Clininic_Manager:
    dialogue: "I admit, we haven't seen as many facility births as we'd like. We're doing everything we can to change that."
    
  Hospital_Administrator:
    dialogue: "Vaccinations are easier to manage. Births take more planning. More resources are likely required to make this work."
    Unlocks: [raise_incentives_for_faciliity_births]
    Unlocks_affects: [raise_incentives_for_faciliity_births]
    feedback:
     Raise_Incentives_For_Faciliity_Births: "That will make this a good deal easier for us."
