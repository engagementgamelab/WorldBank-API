  ngo_manager:
    dialogue: "This is results-based financing. We're responsible for the results, so let us decide on the financing."

      grant_autonomy_to_providers_2: "That's fine by me, but let's discuss it at the end of the year. It's a pretty big change."

  coach:
    dialogue: "Hate to say it, but the NGO has too much power over the budget. We should alter the program to allow providers to make these decisions at their level."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "I've already made myself clear on this a number of times. The RBF Coach knows exactly what the problem is."
