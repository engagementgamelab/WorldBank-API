initiating_dialogue: "I need a little help here. The independent verifier and the Hospital Administrator have built a coalition to box us out of the verification process. This plan gives us the authority to verify any and all reports, but they're pushing back."

  # The below blocks would contain each character that you can interact with (we'll enable/disable them based on the player's "inventory")
  dep_minister_of_health:
    dialogue: "Before we hired the NGO, counterverifying was our responsibility. This is a role we were better suited for."
    unlocks: [revert_counterverification_1]
    unlocks_affects: [revert_counterverification_1]
    feedback: 
      ask_reduce_oversight_2: "This defeats the purpose of our plans. How can we approve funding in good faith if we haven't verified it ourselves?"

  director_regional_health_services:
    dialogue: "Having three levels of verification sounds like overkill to me. And it's confusing to the health providers. Who is the actual final authority on these matters?"
    feedback:
      streamline_speed_verification_process_2: "This will put some strain on our office. I'll do my best to get my office to comply with this."
  ngo_manager:
    feedback:
      revert_counterverification_1: "You hired us to manage this! Why not give us a chance?"
  coach:
    dialogue: "The plan spreads authority across multiple stakeholders, including the Ministry of Health. Whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, that's on them. Let's send around a memo."
    unlocks: [circulate_memo_reaffirming_ministry_authority_2]
    unlocks_affects: [circulate_memo_reaffirming_ministry_authority_2]
    feedback:
      circulate_memo_reaffirming_ministry_authority_2: "I'll make sure everyone gets eyes on this."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "We were hired by the ministry and the NGO to do this work. Having a separate body double everything we're doing is worse than redundant, it's counter-productive."
    unlocks: [ask_reduce_oversight_2]
    unlocks_affects: [ask_reduce_oversight_2]
    feedback:
      warn_verifier_2: "All right. We'll back off. But to say the process is inefficient would be an understatement."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "We're tired of submitting our reports in triplicate. My job is hard enough without all this bureaucracy."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "I have a good relationship with the government, but double-checking takes twice as long. That means it takes twice the time for us to get paid, and my budget can't take that strain."
