      allow_payments_once_5: "It's good to know we can count on you just like you're counting on us."
      deny_payment_5: "We're struggling with these numbers as it is. It hurts patients when we don't have money to work with."

    feedback:
      revise_indicators_at_end_of_year_4: "Okay, at year's end I'll sit the fundholder down with the NGO and we'll figure out some realistic goals. In the meantime, we'll hold payment."

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "It's the same as last time, and until someone says they're making numbers when they're actually making them up, it's not mine to say."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "The other day I followed up with a woman who vaccinated her son against dengue right before the mosquitos got bad. The numbers aren't great, but if the payments stop, that'll be worse."

  hospital_administrator:
    dialogue: "I'm worried that it's not just the prices of these services that's the problem. Even if I had all the money in the world, I couldn't spend it on the supplies I need, since my budget is handed to me by the NGO."
