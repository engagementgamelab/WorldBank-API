      allow_payments_once_5: "It's good to know we can count on you just like you can count on us in case of emergency."
      deny_payment_5: "We're struggling with these numbers as it is. It hurts patients when we don't have money to work with."

  coach:

  third_party_verifier:
    dialogue: "I can confirm that they are not meeting their targets, but other than that I'm not much help."

  community_verifier:
    dialogue: "The other day I followed up with a woman who vaccinated her son against dengue right before the mosquitos got bad. The numbers aren't great, but if the payments stop, it will make the situation worse."

  clinic_manager:
    dialogue: "I am not sure what the NGO is spending the money on but I have not been able to do outreach for the past months. Without that I don't know how we can reach and then treat people."
