# Grading Definitions
# ==============

# This screen should show the number difference between your starting indicator scoreand your ending indicator score, The grade of your plan, and some copy (2-4 sentences) that gives an overview of what happened/will happen (these should also link up to the scenario that might be coming with each plan and can be based off 
# those major choices + how well the plan did grade wise). eventually they will be infographics, but for now lets just use numbers and some generic art.

# Indicators: These are static numbers that will guide the player in knowing where the country starts, where they are at after phase 1, where they begin in phase 2, and what their ultimate results are at the end of phase 2.

# Every beginning of phase 1 starts the same way with the same indicator numbers on average over the course of the year. I'm thinking it would make sense for them to be percentages since phase 2 operates within year benchmarks, so phase 1 will start with the previous year reports. These are:

# Facility Births: 40%
# Vaccinations: 20%
# Quality of Care: 60%

# Rationale: we want to guide the player into thinking that the problem is about the services having potential to be there, but the people are 1. being swayed from using them because of tradtional medicine and 2. hospitals aren't given enough autonmy which results in the lack of services/quality whne patients do go. The low vaccinations/facility births should clue the player into thinking that there is a supply problem.

# There are four possible grades you can get for your plan.

- score: 14-11
  grade: A
  description: "amazing. Simply stunning results! We are seeing unprecedented increases across the board. This is really going to help the country move in the right direction. I don't think there much else you could have done, and I think if we stay the course we will really make a difference in so many lives over the next three years"

# Facility births: +10%
# Vaccinations: +20%
# Quality of care: +15%

- score: 10-8
  grade: B
  description: "This is a pretty good plan. I think there might have been a better way to handle this, but I think this will do just fine! we are seeing increases across the board. With a little tweaking, we might even be able to hit our three year goals"

# Facility births: +5%
# Vaccinations: +15%
# Quality of care: +5%

- score: 7-4
  grade: C
  description: "It seems like we are somewhat around where we started. I think we will have to make signfiicant changes to the plan moving forward in order to bring up these numbers. We might even want to redirect the distribution of funds soon."
# Facility births: 0
# Vaccinations: -5%
# Quality of care: 0

- score: 3-1
  grade: D
  description: "It seems like the plan you suggested has made things worse. We are seeing even less services delivered than before our RBF plan was put into place. Maybe RBF isn't the right answer after all...we will still move forward with the next two years. I would recommend shifting the plan immediately and reorganizing the direction of change you put into place." 
# Facility births: -8%
# Vaccinations: -10%
# Quality of care: 0%

- score: 0-0
  grade: F
  description: "There are just not enough initiatives put into place for this plan to move forward. Because of this, we weren't able to conduct an evaluation. I would recommend spending more time in the country in order to gather more information. Try visiting multiple cities and learning from many different people. You never know what you might learn."
